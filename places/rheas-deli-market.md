This is a corner store and **sandwich** store with a whole bunch of vegan options. They recently got in [Prime Roots](https://www.primeroots.com/) options, which I think are the best vegan deli meats around currently. They also have their own fake beef and layonna chicken.

I got an option with some vegan meat and mushroom pate. It was pretty good, I want to try some of the others though.

I was very surprised to find out that this dilapidated bubble tea shop is actually a chain. I got a iced green tea, fried tofu, and fried onion rings for $15 all up.

The fried things were fried in a depressing and sickening way and not in a delightful and lifegiving way. I do not recommend.

The tea was delightful though, I recommend that.

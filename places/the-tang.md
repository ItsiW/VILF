While I haven't tried enough here to give it a full endorsement, the **hot and sour noodles** were pretty tasty and refreshing. Kinda wish they had a vegan noodle soup option with wheat noodles though.

The prices are much lower than the upmarket feel of the place. They've got a pretty good drinks selection, and they gave me really good complementary oolong tea.

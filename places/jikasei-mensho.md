This place surprised me, it's in the back corner of this food court market place in a dingy part of Soma near Market. There is no vibe here.

There is exactly one vegan thing on the menu. The **vegan yuzu shio abura soba**. It is incredibly delicious. It is brothless, but refreshing. With a lot of very good toppings including large colorful eggplant chunks.

I paid $24 after tip and tax, which is a lot for a few noodles, but who can really put a price on wow that's yum.

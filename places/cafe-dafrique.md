So far this is the best Ethiopian/Eritrean food I've had in the Bay. We got the **injerito** and **samosas to start** which were both excellent. The injerito was injera slathered with a spiced filling and rolled up (v tasty), and the samosas came with this great basil side sauce/topping. We got the **vegetarian combination platter** which came with a whole assortment of dishes. Between those it was enough for 3 people (with one not being that hungry) and costed around $45 between all of us for the food including tax and tip.

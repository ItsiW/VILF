Newish Burmese place with quite a few vegan options. I made a mistake and got the **tea leaf salad**. Like yeah it's a good benchmark, but shoulda gone for something that's more specific to them. Good flavor, way too much lettuce. I wanna go back and try the shwe taung noodles.

$20 after tax and tip, so pricey for a salad.

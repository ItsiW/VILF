Very yummy bakery in the middle of nowhere on a farm. We got the **garlic rosemary** loaf that was hot and had whole roasted pieces of garlic in it. We smashed it in no time. I would easily go back and destroy more loaves. They also had vegan scones and cookies, but I don't like sweet things. Maybe next time.

Paid like $12 with tax and tip, so an expensive loaf but very worth it, especially if you consider it a lunch for 3.

This is a nice takeaway Mexican spot with a pretty snazzy bar in the back. They have a **vegan Impossible chorizo** which they can do as tacos, burritos or quesadillas. Prices are on the upper side of takeaway Mexican prices but it's tasty, and open til 2 and near the 1st Ave train station for when you're coming home drunk.

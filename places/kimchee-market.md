It's possible I just got the wrong thing here. I got the **rice with banchan** thinking I'd get a taster of a few good things. It was a bit under $10, probably not worth it for what it included. But they've got a bunch of other things one the menu that look promising so I don't want to give this place a bad rating just yet.

One of the kimchis was really good, two I thought were ok and the beans and greens were a bit flavourless. Idk get something else. 

The grocery component here isn't the best, you can get better selection at most Asian supermarkets. However they have vegan kimchi so that's a plus!

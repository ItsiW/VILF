The vegan option here are the **nopales** (cactus) tacos. Star of the show is actually the corn tortillas they make right in front of you. The pricing doesn't end up being that good at $4.25 each because you'd need a whole bunch of them to be full. 

I believe the music in there is purposefully annoying to make you leave quickly.

All in all fun and there's a lot of salsas and stuff you can put on it. Good for a lunchtime snack or something.

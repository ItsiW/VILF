This seems like a highly gentrified Indian place with too many options, but it was also pretty tasty, so you win this time. I got the **vada pav** which they can make vegan. Pretty punchy flavors, all around tasty. I think it was around $10 all up with tax.

Edit: ended up going back with friends to try more things. We got the **pani puri** which was ok, and a veganized version of kachori chaat, but that wasn't amazing.

Very cute Burmese restaurant in Richmond. A very energetic man (I believe the owner) directed us to the patio out the back where we sat in some marquees with some heaters.

The menu has a lot of options, and all the vegan ones are clearly marked. Always go for the salads. We went for a light meal of their **signature tea leaf salad**, **tamarind leaf salad**, and garlic rice noodles. It was very tasty, I hadn't had tamarind leaf before, hard to describe but it was my favourite. The garlic noodles were just ok, but it was a nice contrast and palate cleanser between bites of the very flavourful salads. Beers are also $5 and they have cheap wine.

I absolutely want to go back and try way more things. It's not the cheapest, we paid $60 (including tips and tax) for three kinda small dishes and a beer, but I think it's definitely worth it.

If you ever find yourself wishing you were in the 1990s in an Eastern European grandmother's living room/beer hall, boy do I have the place for you. 

On E 7th St, you'll see a WWII memorial plaque, with a blue Cyrillic sign underneath. Head down the stairs and open the nondescript door. You'll be in a hallway but hopefully it's the right one. The door immediately to your left is the time capsule that takes you into the restaurant.

They have a couple vegan things, there are **potato pierogis** (topped with fried onions or apple sauce) and **borscht**. No crazy popping flavours but it's all very nice and homemade, and definitely not bad for $9 all up. Solid choice for lunch.

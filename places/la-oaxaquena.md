Glory be to La Oaxaqueña. They redid their menu in the last year and put a bunch of vegan things on the menu, including their homemade **vegan birria sauce tacos**. You can get them with jackfruit, grilled veggies, soy chorizo, or impossible meat, and you can mix and match them (seen above). And they're like $4 each. Very tasty.

And the place is open til 2.30 am.

God bless.

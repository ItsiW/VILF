We got a veggie Tlayuda, which is like a big-ass tostada. It's covered in all the standard veggie mexican toppings. Because it's so large it takes ages to get through, and it slowly becomes soggy as you go. Extremely messy ordeal. It's tasty but expensive (like $25) and all-in-all not too much better than other standard veggie Mexican options. I guess a fun shared meal.

Excellent Chinese restaurant, on par with [Wojia](/places/wojia-hunan-cuisine). We got a whole bunch of crap including **tan tan noodles** (that they could make vegan), **mapo tofu**, **eggplant**, lots of other stuff too.

We got too much food but you could get out under $20 a head including tips and tax.

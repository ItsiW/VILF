Much like most of the other cheap dumpling houses in the area, the vegan options here are the **veg dumplings** and **scallion pancake**. Here you can get both for like $5. (maybe the peanut noodles are vegan too).

Everything here is quite bready and satisfying. Dumplings are cabbage-forward.

Better than [North Dumpling](/places/north-dumpling) and [King Dumplings](/places/king-dumplings); cheaper but not as good as [Vanessa's](/places/vanessas-dumpling-house).

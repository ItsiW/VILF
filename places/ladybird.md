Ladybird is a popular vegan restaurant that does inventive things with vegetables. We got these eggplant fritter things, korean fried broccoli, mushroom toast and mushroom buns.

Things are good here, they're tasty. But nothing really blew me away and it's pretty pricey. So I probably won't be going back.

Really cool Yemeni coffee shop. They have tons of specialty **spiced coffees** and teas. On the food side, I got a spinach fatayer (triangle pastry) which was only ok. But they had this **pistachio pomegranate log dessert** like a turkish delight which was incredible, and I hate desserts. Make sure you ask which options are vegan, a lot of the desserts (like the baklava) are not.

I paid $22.44 including tips and tax for a coffee and these two food things.

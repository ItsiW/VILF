Little matcha cafe with a very serious looking Japanese chef in the back. The matcha was nice. But this is not a review site for matcha, that is many other people's game. And we are in the game of harsh vegan food reviews. They only have one vegan food, it is the **shitake mushroom & pickle onigiri**, you get a plate of 2 for $9 after tip and tax. Very seaweed-forward flavor. Very tasty. I will be back for a snack.

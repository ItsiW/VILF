This place has an interesting menu, a mash-up of Malay, Chinese, burgers, and some other stuff that they seem to have invented. Make sure to check that the things your order are vegan, because a lot of it isn't.

I got the **Curry Stuffed Combination Noodle Soup** and swapped out the egg noodles that normally come with it for another kind (think it was rice?). While it looked laksa-esque, I was pleasantly surprised because it wasn't coconut-forward, but still very rich. It had a strong fresh chilli flavour. It came with a variety of tofu preparations that were really tasty and soaked up the broth well.

It's fairly expensive for the area (around $17 after it was all said and done), but the portion was enormous. I'd want to come back with a few people and split some things. At the time of writing, the menu they had is like 10-20% more expensive than what they have listed online.

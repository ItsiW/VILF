They have a good **miso ramen** that they can do vegan.

They have a vegan green curry ramen too but nothing to write home about unless you really like green curry but it doesn't taste too different from the kind of stuff you can make at home with a paste pretty easily.

They have a bunch of vegan sides and stuff too but the ramen is big enough for a big boy like me.

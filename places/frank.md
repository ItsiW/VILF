So the vegan option on the menu is spaghetti with broccoli, garlic and oil. You may be thinking, "is this really just garlic oil pasta with some broccoli chucked in", and yes, yes it is.

I mean sure garlic olive oil pasta is tasty... but you can make it at home for no money, and the broccoli just sticks out. Not sure what's going on here. And it's like $21 before tips and tax.

And again... because there was no cheese it wasn't salty enough and they didn't compensate, so I needed to add salt in.

Not a fan, but the wine was good. I'd come here for drinks. They have a schtick where you can order a bottle and just pay for as much as you drink.

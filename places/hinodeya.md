This ramen tasted like breakfast. It was a soy milk base... and it kinda just tasted like soymilk. All the elements didn't really jive together even though they all seemed nice on their own. I have never in my life just left half a meal there. Two of us couldn't finish the bowl... it was just not good.

Shishito peppers were nice tho... had a sweet glaze on them and everything. And $5... I'd go for that again.

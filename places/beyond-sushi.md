Beyond Sushi is this vegan sushi chain. There was a ton of hyper for this place online. Unfortunately does not live up to it at all. Got the impossible meat **dumplings** (which were pretty good but not spicy enough for how red the sauce was), and the **spicy mango**, **mushroom**, and **spicy tuna** rolls. They were fine, I liked the tuna one the best it was actually kinda fish-like. But around the board the flavours were kinda muted and we left going "oh that was kinda interesting" rather than "mmm tasty".

However the menu is quite large, so gonna go back and try some other things. It's entirely possible we just got the wrong stuff, please educate me if that's the case.

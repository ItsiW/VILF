Nice little taqueria. They've got a veg California burrito with a bunch of veggies and tofu. Paired with the table salsas it's ok. But nothing too interesting. Best place to go for veggie burritos is still [La Cumbre](/places/la-cumbre-taqueria-sf).

Costed $14 all up including tax and tip, and they chuck in the tortilla chips for free.

A knish seems to be a big lump of mashed potato scantily dressed in pastry. Like most Jewish food, it is stodgy, shaped close to a sphere, and has never managed to catch on in most of the world.

Many of the flavours are vegan, shown here is **spinach knish**. This means it is a lot of mashed potato with a bit of spinach. You can get similar situations with cabbage, mushroom, etc. They're under $5.

If you want a lot of mashed potato in a handheld form at a low price, this is the place for you.

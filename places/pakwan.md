I fucking love Pakwan. It is a straight hit of greasy flavor to the system served with fresh **roti**. When you get the curries take away they come with a cm or two of oil at the top of the container, like there should be. The vibe is the exact vibe you want while consuming these delicacies.

The vegan curries are all clearly marked. I would highly suggest getting the **Aloo Palak** (spinach and potatoes), it is the best version of it I've ever had. The **Channa Masala** and **Daal** are also excellent, I haven't made my way through the whole menu though. 

Curries are cheap enough, under $15 with tax and tip, with a roti the portions will kill you.

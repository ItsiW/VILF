This place makes fresh baked bread stuffed with stuff. The only vegan option is the **misticanza alla romana** which is a bunch of braised greens in a ton of oil. Imagine the best Chinese greens side dish. Super garlicy and oily and a bit spicy but bitter as well. The bread is super fresh and crunchy and hot. Real nice stuff. It kinda fall everywhere as you eat it. 

Best snack I've found so far. Like $11 when it was all said and done so a pricey snack but very worth it.

They've got some other vegan snacks and nibbles, various antipasti and fried artichoke hearts. And I think maybe some vegan pastas. It's pretty affordable for how fancy it is. I'll be back.

After the disappointment of [Xi'an Famous](/places/xian-famous) I've been looking for good Xi'an food. This place doesn't have a huge amount of vegan selection, but they do have **cold skin nooldes** (liangpi) which is a classic. Springy flat noodles with bean sprouts cucumber slices and drenched in sauce, with small bits of gluten to absorb it. Normally I've had them sesame-forward but this was more chilli-forward. It's pretty oily and messy but very declicious and refreshing.

The veggie dumplings are good. Really large and perfectly made and cooked with a chewy wrapper and crispy bottom. The filling was a bit bland, a cabbage and mixed veg situation, but it worked well when dipped into the liangpi sauce.

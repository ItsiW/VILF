Pretty good Burmese place! The tea leaf salad aint that good compared to the other ones out there, and the samusas are only so-so, but they make up for it with the **Shan noodles** and **pea shoots**, yummo! Also cocktails were pretty great.

Not a cheap place though. A cocktail and food ended up costing about $60 a head including tips and tax. Not yummo.

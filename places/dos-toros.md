This is an efficient way to get from not full to full. It's kinda vaguely salty and spicy and not offensive. You've had a standard chain burrito before, you know what the deal is.

The impossible meat option doesn't add that much to the experience, so you can save a bit of money and get the plain one for like $7, it's enormous.

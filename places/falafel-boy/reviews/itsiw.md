This place doesn't seem like the kind of place that has good falafel, but it does. I got the **falafel cauliflower vegan plate** which came with a bunch of stuff and it was actually pretty good. Not a very cohesive meal but all the elements were tasty.

Green, crispy falafel. Tasty tahina sauce. What more does a falafel boy need.

I paid $16.50 total so it's quite expensive for those in the falafel game.

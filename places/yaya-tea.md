Yaya Tea is a boba tea and **onigiri** chain. There's quite a few dotted around the city. 

They serve warm and hefty onigiri (rice triangles) with a bunch of vegan options. I opted this time for citrus spare rib and ginger chicken, both made with soy protein. Didn't love the fillings on either but they're fun. I kinda prefer the seaweed one. There's also sour plum, spring roll, plain, and gong bao chicken in the vegan category.

I'm kinda confused by the preparation. They take a while to come out so I assume they're fresh, but they come wrapped in the 7/11 style plastic that you need  to shimmy off. I guess it's for the nostalgia feeling? But I'd prefer the option to have it without the plastic.

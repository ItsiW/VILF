I'm still looking for good Xi'an food in the city. This place is ok. The **cold noodles** and **cucumber salad** are good. The hand ripped noodles (biang biang mian) and vegetable dumplings were not, both a bit flavourless and stodgy. 

All in all there's some ok things here if you're in the area. Otherwise [Bites of Xi'an](/places/bites-of-xian/) has better versions of things, and I think there's one of them nearby-ish in East Village.

Also just way too much plastic, my god.

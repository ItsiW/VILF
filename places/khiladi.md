Nice little Indian restaurant with Northern and Southern food. There's quite a lot they can do vegan. I got the **masala dosa** which was very tasty and came with great chutneys. Not a crispy dosa though, it was all pretty soft, so not my favourite but still good. Around $17 after tips and tax I'll be back to try all the other stuff.

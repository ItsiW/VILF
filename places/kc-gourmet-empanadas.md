Empanadas and other Panamanian food. There's 6 things on their vegan menu, more than are listed on their website. It also looks like a bunch of other sides, soups and sliders are vegan too, so more than you think.

I got the **spicy vegan mushroom** empanada, which was great. Bursting with mushrooms, and all the empanadas are fried fresh to order so they're super hot and crispy. The hot sauce is great too (they have two sauces, one has mayo in it so ask them to not give you that). They didn't have any more of their vegan tamale, so I got the **ultimate veggie empanada** which sounded bad and was bad. Biting through crispy fried pastry to mushy broccoli and carrots? Not on.

I will be back to try other things and the soups and stuff. They've also got a bunch of fun drinks and a vegan rice pudding.

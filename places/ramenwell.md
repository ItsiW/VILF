Ramen shop with a **Vegan Ramen** option. They also have vegan mac salad.

No reason to get the vegan mac salad, I believe it's more of a nostalgia affair for those who like it, but the ramen was pretty tasty. VERY mushroomy, kinda lost interest by the end but it was pretty good and I'd check it out. 

A bit over $26 for both (getting yikesy) but of course cheaper without the mac.

Theoretically seemed like a great falafel place. They've got the big frier out the front and you can see them make them all fresh. They're crispy and green, but unfortunately a bit watery and bland inside. Also the salads must have been sitting out for quite a while.

But you get a lot of food for $14 all up for the big plate. Make sure you get it without feta.

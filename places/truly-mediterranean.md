Theoretically seemed like a great **falafel** place. They've got the big frier out the front and you can see them make them all fresh. They're crispy and green, but unfortunately a bit watery and bland inside. Also the salads must have been sitting out for quite a while. But still, it gets the job done.

You get a lot of food for $14 all up for the big plate. Make sure you get it without feta. Also you can get the soup pretty cheap.

Those who are any less than pickle admirers should avert their eyes. 

This is a pickle workshop. You need to send an email to book and you get to sit and witness the pickle work being done. You get 15 of the most Berkeley-esque farm-to-table-organic-handmade **pickles in a rice bowl** and it's outstanding. I think every week is different, as they are constantly riffing with what they have available and what they remembered they were working on a few years ago. It's around $39 for the tasting and you can add on drinks and extras (the sesame goma dofu is worth it).

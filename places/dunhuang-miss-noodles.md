There seems to be a trend where there's some quite good hand-pulled noodle places that just don't have good vegan options to prepare them with. Got the **vegetarian pan fried noodles**, the noodles were great but the stir fry itself was a little sparse on the veggies and just not super flavourful. If you're just in the mood for that noodle experience then yeah, sure. They've also got oil spill noodles if that's your thing. They advertise the Mala Noodle on the menu as vegetarian, but when I asked they said it was a beef broth.

They do have a ton of what I assume are vegan appetisers and sides. All the traditional standards like eggplant salad, shredded potato, mung bean noodle etc. so I'd go back with a group to check it out. Because this place seems fairly legit and the prices are pretty reasonable.

This is an all-vegan Sichuan place. Less fancy and less trendy locat that the West Village version. A LOT has been said about Spicy Moon, but what I think they nail is making great versions of some Sichuan standards that are better and cheaper than any non-vegan Chinese restaurants in Manhattan (though Han Dynasty is good too).

Definitely go at lunch time for the $13 special that gets you a main (normally around $18) as well as a couple fried dumplings. Also there's plenty of drinks.

That being said, not everything is great. Most is good, but the things they do well, they do really well.

Things that are great:
- **dry pepper style with potatoes** (pictured). The server recommended them as the best thing on the menu and I think I agree, the big crispy nuggets of potato and tofu are really good.
- **cold sesame noodles** lmao my friend had never had Sichuan pepper before and he never had his mouth numbed and I laughed at him

Things that are good:
- **wontons in chilli oil**
- **dan dan noodles**
- **scallion pancakes**

Things that are ok:
- **mapo tofu**
- **fried/steamed veg dumplings**

Things that are bad:
- **hen of the woods**

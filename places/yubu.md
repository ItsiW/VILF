This place sells korean lemonades and **yubu**, these small pockets of sweet seasoned bean curd filled with rice and a topping. I was familiar with the Japanese version inari, which seems very similar.

These were the best version of that I've had. They're pricy for what they are, pretty small and around $3.50 each but a very tasty snack. I got spicy mushroom and mushroom bulgogi, they're fairly similar. There's also an avocado one.

Be warned they may try to sneak some haribo gummy bears into your bag. I understand it's nice but gelatin isn't very nice. But I let them know they're not vegan so here's hoping.

This is a nice Cambodian restaurant. All the flavors are nice but like everything vegetarian is a mixed veg dish. I've never had a mixed veg dish that landed. You gotta focus on one veg.

We got the rice crepe which was tasty but a little one-note, needed a lot of the tamarind sauce. And a stew flavoured with roasted rice powder. Tasty but let down by the veg itself.

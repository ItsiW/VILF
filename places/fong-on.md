Soy boys of the world unite. 

This place makes tofu in various forms. I went for their **sweet silken tofu** dessert. This is one of the few good desserts in the world if you've never had it. It is truly phenomenal.

Freshly made, hot, unpressed tofu with a brown sugar syrup. You can get it with toppings but it's perfect to me just plain. $4.50 including tax. They also have soft or firm tofu blocks, a savoury preparation of the silken tofu (although I don't know if they do that vegan), soy milk, tea, and grass jelly (check vegan status).

I sat out in the cold, snowy day outside the shop, with steam coming off the tofu. It was sweet an delicious.

There are some things in life that are just good. This is one of them.

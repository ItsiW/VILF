In this unassuming small booze shop you'll find a little taco counter. Excellent place to grab a bite after watching the Barbie movie at Alamo Drafthouse.

They've got a few vegan options, importantly they have **flor de calabaza** (zucchini flowers) and **huitlacoche** (corn fungus) which they prepare as simple tacos for like $5 each. Plenty of sides of salsas and pickled veg.

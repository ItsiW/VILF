Nice ramen spot. I got the **veggie miso ramen** which they can make vegan. Toppings worked well. Lotus root can keep its status as most interesting vegetable shape, well done.

After tips and tax I paid a little over $21. On the pricier side but they do have a pretty good happy hour with $5 gyoza plates and cheap beer, so maybe aim for that.

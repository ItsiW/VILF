Vietnamese place with a few veggie options. I got the **tofu in clay pot**. The rice was nice, had some flavour and got crispy. But it was pretty let down by the tofu and veg. They picked very watery vegetables that didn't really gel well with the dish, kinda the standard lazy veg substitutions of broccoli and zucchini. I wouldn't really go back there when there's better ones in the area, like the beyond bibimbap at [Gyu-Kaku](/places/gyu-kaku).

Do you ever wake up feeling you want a Mexicanized version of Americanized Chinese food? Well boy do I have the place for you.

I got fried noodles and black beans, as they seemed like the most substantial vegan options there. It was actually pretty solid for what it was, and there's both hot sauce and chilli oil on the table to doctor it up.

For two options it costed about $9 all up which is pretty good. Definitely an efficient way to become full.

This place always has a crazy long line out the front. Should take like 30 mins - 1 hour to get seated. It's this little Japanese restaurant that serves little plates. It's incredibly cozy inside. 

Tastiest things were the **beans** and **tomato shots**. I heard the black tofu is good too but they ran out.

It is pricey though, be warned, you need to get quite a few dishes.

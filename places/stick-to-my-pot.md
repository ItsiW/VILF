Normally I like my **veggie dumplings** with a green chive-like filling, but this is like my first time I liked a mixed veg situation, they had a lot of mala flavour and stuff. And great texture. First actually good dumplings I've had in New York.

The **scallion pancakes** are top tier. Get one.

They have some cheap (like $4) scallion oil noodles, they're not amazing but good filler. The portions here are kinda small so it's not a terrible idea.

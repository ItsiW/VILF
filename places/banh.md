This is a good **banh mi**, you should get this sandwich. It's the vegan pesto one. Bread's good, insides are good. All the pickled carrots and stuff and some cancerously smoked mushrooms, great stuff. If the tofu had more flavour and they had something a bit more pate-like for ~~mouth-feel~~ then it'd probably be phenominal.

But that's it. I wouldn't bother with the rest of the menu. Just get the sandwich takeaway. The other vegan things feature the same kinda stuff in different arrangements, and none are as good as the sandwich.

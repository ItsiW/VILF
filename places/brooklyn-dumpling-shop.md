You can get some pretty overpriced and pretty meaty textured **impossible meat dumplings** here. Like really nailed the texture. It's a little flavourless but yeah. Also could definitely be crispier. And I paid close to $9 so the value ain't quite there.

The place itself is futury wank that doesn't really work. They have these little compartments you pick up your food from, and you order from a screen. I guess the idea is to do *efficiency* by removing human interaction. But there process is slow as hell. There wasn't a crazy line and there's only be an order going out every 5 mins or so, even though it's mostly small snacks. I waited over 20 mins when they said 5, and one guy was getting pissed off coz he was there for over 40 mins. And then they kept having to come out and apologize.

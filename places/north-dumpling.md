This dumpling spot is astonishingly cheap. The **sesame pancake** isn't as much a pancake as sesame bread. It's not made fresh, but it's still bread so still good, you can get it filled with veggies.

The **veggie dumplings** are solid, very cabbagey. Not too flavorful but you can cover it in vinegar and hot sauce. The dumplings were $5 cash and the sandwich was $3. Value town.

If you want cheap food, sure, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it and there's better places in the area.

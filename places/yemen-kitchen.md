A place that google maps describes as "unassuming" which I translate as maximal number of assumptions. This is a hole-in-the-wall little restaurant. I got the **northern beans** sandwich which was maybe $12 all up? Turns out you get two big wraps with their homemade Yemeni bread, filled with tasty beans. Nothing too unexpected, beans and spices and bread, hits the spot.

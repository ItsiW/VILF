This Vietnamese place told me they only had one vegan option, which was the **veggie pho**. It's pretty tasty and fresh. Not the best around but way better than a lot of other ones. They have their own chilli oil to add which is nice. It was $13 for a small of $15 for a large (pictured) before tips and tax.

The MVP is the table water with huge chunks of cucumber, lemon and mint. Ace stuff.

These guys make **Venetian sandwiches**. I'm not sure exactly what that means but there's a live stream of a canal in Venice inside. I think it has something to do with the olive oil bread the use. It gets very nice and crispy.

They don't have anything vegan on the menu, but the guy running the shop was really nice. After I confirmed that I was in fact yes serious about being vegan, he was initially a little reluctant to make me something because he didn't think it would be good enough, but then changed his mind and put something together for me.

It was a pumpkin, tomato and greens situation, but what made it good was that he used like a pistachio nut butter on one side, and a mushroom/truffle paste on the other. They were very tasty. However he fell for the classic Italian mistake of not putting salt back in when he removed the cheese (see my rant on [San Marzano](/places/san-marzano/)). I should have just asked for some salt but he was going out of his way to be nice and extra hospitable, and I didn't want to seem rude. He even gave me a free bag of chips while I waited.

Hopefully they'll add some vegan stuff to the menu, think they could really have something going if they workshop this a little bit.

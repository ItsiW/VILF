Great and cozy spot for Ethiopian food. The $20 **feast** is enough for two people for lunch so it's pretty good value too. The whole menu is vegan which is a plus. It comes with all the hits on injera including mushrooms, greens, and lots of different lentils which are my favourite. You can pick 7 of the 9 available so plenty of choice.

The drinks are also top notch, and they've got a lot of cheap options.

Really good, highly recommend.

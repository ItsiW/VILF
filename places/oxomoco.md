Super swanky Mexican spot. There's a few things on the menu they can do vegan, so we tried a bunch of them. Big sampling **plate of salsas** with fried tortillas, dried mango with chilli, **beet "chorizo" tacos**, and **spring pea tlayuda** (big tostado). We liked everything except the mango. The pea stuff was great, so were the beet tacos. The salsas had a big variety.

Everything was good. Tasty stuff. But all the vegan options are very tortilla-forward. And for two people with a couple drinks each it was around $60 a head after it was all said and done. It's good, but that's too much money for it.

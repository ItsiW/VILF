Luckyduck is a cafe and bicycle shop, for all your cafe and bicycle shop needs. Every time I have been it has been extremely warm inside. 

They have a bunch of vegan sandwiches, I got the Vegan Rachel which I guess was meant to be kinda like a reuben. Idk it was fine. Didn't blow me away. That being said I don't have the same American predilection for sandwiches that you do, dear reader.

It was $12 so what like $15-$16 after tips and tax for a sandwich... idk

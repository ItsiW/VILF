This is a world-famous **dosa** stand in Washington Square Park. It's been covered in countless articles and youtube videos. Everything they sell is vegan.

It's pretty good dosa and $9, but you pay with your time. It takes about an hour to clear the line on a good day (maybe less if you go when it opens), and you gotta check their facebook page to see if they're open on any day. 

It's good, but not better than most other dosas I've had. If you want to save time you could probably head to a South Indian restaurant in the area.

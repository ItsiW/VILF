This place is so cool I almost don't want to tell people about it. It's a Japanese diner on the second floor of an arcade, in a bridge that links two buildings. It is so kitschy in the best way possible, the walls are lined with anime paraphernalia (including some playing on the tvs) and tons of sakes and beers. You sit at a little counter and it's a very comfortable atmosphere. 

They have a lot of veg options, the old Japanese man owner running to and fro behind the counter will fetch you a vegetarian menu, they have lots of food including both Japanese and Japanese-European options (so many kinds of spaghetti). We opted for the **daikon sansai udon**, which they were happy to make cold with a dipping sauce. It was so tasty. It was well priced, I think we paid under $30 for that and a large Asahi black (which was like $15 itself, the drinks are not so cheap but huge selection).

Be absolutely sure to check that things are vegan though, and to request things without bonito flakes. They added some to ours even though we ordered off the vegetarian menu. I think it was a genuine mistake though, and they confirmed that the dashi dipping sauce was vegan. However if we hear they do this again we may have to take this place off the map.

I will definitely be back.

This is a **Sichuan place** with a menu that is frankly too large. However that means there's a lot of veggie options. However that means there's a lot of ways to order the wrong thing. I think I got something ok, but coulda been better. I got the Hunan steamed eggplant with chili, it was fine, standard eggplant in gluggy sauce. Some of the fried dishes looked a lot better. Also they've got an entire stinky tofu section.

I think I'd only come here again with a lot of people to try some things.

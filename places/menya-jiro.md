This is the **veggie miso spicy ramen** that every other miso ramen wants to be. Hands down the best ramen I've had in New York so far. It's super creamy with a deep flavour, and the noodles are springy and all around top notch. The huge pile of lettuce on top was a bit confusing but you know it kinda worked.

I am already dreaming of coming back here. It's a bit pricey at $20.50 after tax (they didn't ask for a tip but I don't know if that was my bad or not), but they have some cheap beers and sakes alongside expensive stuff. And the cubes of lightly fried tofu were so perfectly shaped, you gotta pay extra for that. Also they have another hemp miso ramen that could be fun to try.

It's a nice place, you should go here.

This is the **veggie miso spicy ramen** that every other miso ramen wants to be. Hands down the best ramen I've had in New York so far. It's super creamy with a deep flavour, and the noodles are springy and all around top notch. The huge pile of lettuce on top was a bit confusing but you know it kinda worked.

I am already dreaming of coming back here. It's a bit pricey at $20.50 after tax, but they don't ask for tips which we love to see. They also have some cheap beers and sakes alongside expensive stuff. And the cubes of lightly fried tofu were so perfectly shaped, you gotta pay extra for that. 

I got the hemp ramen as well which wasn't as good, a salty creamy vibe.

It's a nice place, you should go here. They've also got one in midtown but I don't know if the menu is the same there.

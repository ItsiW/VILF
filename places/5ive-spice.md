This is nominally a taco and banh mi shop, but none of the tacos are vegan and the banh mi wasn't the standout. I think the other things here are what you should go for. They use a soy protein fake meat situation in the banh mi. It's a bit too sweet and overpowering, and makes the whole thing come off as a fake meat sandwhich rather than a banh mi. Like it's good fake meat but I wanted a banh mi. I still think the best one I've found so far is [BÃ¡nh] at the upper end of the Upper West Side.

However, for $4 extra bucks you can get a decently sized side of **brussel sprouts** which were really good, like worth coming back for alone. They're really well caramelised with great garnishes and a kinda tangy sauce. Apologies for not taking a photo but it's really good.

I'm gonna go back to try the pho and other sides, this is a place that clearly puts a lot of effort into the stuff they do and at a pretty good price point for the quality.

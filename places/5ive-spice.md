This is nominally a taco and banh mi shop, but none of the tacos are vegan and the banh mi wasn't the standout. Really the **sides** here are what to go for. They use a soy protein fake meat situation in the banh mi. It's a bit too sweet and overpowering, and makes the whole thing come off as a fake meat sandwhich rather than a banh mi. Like it's good fake meat but I wanted a banh mi. I still think the best one I've found so far is [BÃ¡nh](/places/banh) at the upper end of the Upper West Side.  I've also had the pho here which is a good hangover cure but not incredible.

However, for $4 extra bucks (with a banh mi) you can get a decently sized side of **brussel sprouts** which were really good, like worth coming back for alone. They're really well caramelised with great garnishes and a kinda tangy sauce. Apologies for not taking a photo of that but it's really good. I also got the **broccoli** another time which is sauteed and drenched in a garlic-scallion-soy dressing situation which is really nice.

This is a place that clearly puts a lot of effort into the stuff they do and at a pretty good price point for the quality.
Sorry it's taken me a bit of time to get back to you.

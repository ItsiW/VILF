The lunch deal ends up being around $17 after tips and tax, and I got the **Buddha Ramen** and **veg dumplings** which were both nice enough. The ramen has a salty soy broth which a bunch of toppings and a small fried tofu. Keep in mind you need to sub the noodles out to make it vegan, I got the spinach noodles. The dumplings are ok, the chilli oil that came with it is actually really good.

It might be better if you get stuff from the Tibetan half of the menu but I'm not sure, seeing as they led with the ramen half. The board advertised extremely cheap drinks, which is the big appeal of why I might be back. Like $3-$5 including beers and sake. Nice.

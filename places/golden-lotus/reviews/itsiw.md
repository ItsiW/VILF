One of those Vegan Asian restaurants with everything on the menu. I got their **house clay pot rice**. It was a ton of carbs with some nice seasoning and veggies, a lot of ginger flavor. I paid $19 all up including tips and tax, so pricey for what it was.

Normally when I get clay pot rice it's got a nice crispy layer at the bottom, and this one didn't really get that. But it was still nice. I'll combe back here to try more stuff. There is a lot of stuff.

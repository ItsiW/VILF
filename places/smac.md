I don't remember the last time I had to throw out food. This is a mac n' cheese restaurant. But absolutely not. We are just not there with vegan cheese for this to be palatable, especially in such a huge portion. I got the medium one for like $11 and it was far too much. It was creamy textured and kinda bland, and I could feel my arteries clogging up for no real benefit. You can get add ons (I got mushrooms, tomatoes, maybe something else) and they just don't come through that much. The sauces provided just completely drown out the flavour coz it's a bit flavourless by itself.

Maybe I'm missing something, maybe you need childhood nostalgia to enjoy mac n' cheese, and I've never really had much of it in my life. But also I felt ill having eaten the half of it that I did.

Very Chinese American place with a huge vegan selection, including dim sum and vegan meats. We get the veg dim sum combination plate and orange meatless chicken. All in all it's fine, but nothing was amazing. I guess it's worth coming to scratch the itch. Although it'd probable be worth coming back to try more. 

A bit under $20 a head.

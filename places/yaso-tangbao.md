I was pretty pumped for this place given it's extensive vegan menu, but the stuff is pretty low to mediocre quality. I got the hot noodles with peanut sesame sauce, I think they use really cheap noodles so it's something you can make better at home with a few ingredients. And it was so overly sweet. I got the veggie wontons as well which were better, packed with spinach. But the sauce wasn't very great, too sweet again and not very spicy like advertised.

I'm also pretty over sit down places using single use plastic plates and utensils.

I might go again if i'm in the area to try the veggie bao or something but my hopes aren't too high.

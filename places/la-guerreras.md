I might not be the best person to review this as I'm not the biggest lover of Mexican food. The stuff here is very beautifully presented with lots of colorful elements. I got the mole and plantain taco, and a veggie empanada, which together costed $15 included tax and tips. It's very fresh and clearly a lot of effort has gone in. However, I found the flavors kind of mild, and in the mole taco, the plantain was the main thing I could taste. If you're a visual and textural eater, I think this might be more the place for you. They also have a vegan tamale, maybe that's good.

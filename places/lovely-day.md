This is a nice cafe next to Elizabeth Street Garden in Nolita. They've got  nice coffee and some vegan snacks. We got fried tofu in chilli sauce (not amazing), spinach with sesame (pretty tasty), and **wasabi guacamole** which was great, but they didn't come with any chips. We had to pull a sneaky and go buy our own at a nearby deli.

The menu is very confused here, be warned. Also at night I think they put a bunch of tables out on the street and it becomes more of a bar.

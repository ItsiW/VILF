An all-vegan Mexican spot. We got a whole loada stuff. It felt like most plates were bulked out with beans and rice, but it was kinda pricey. 

Best things were actually the beans. As well as the corn tortillas which were kinda smokey, and the fajitas which were also a bit smokey. Also the paloma pitcher was v good.Everything else was kinda nice. Group consensus was that we wouldn't recommend the place to anyone.

We ended up paying like $40 a head. You can do a lot better for that.

Hole in the wall place for **falafel sandwich**. Like it's fine but I won't be going back because there's just better around. For like $8 you get a decent sized sandwich. The falafel itself isn't that bad, green and crispy, and the toasted pita is nice. But the whole thing is under-salted, and missing important elements like pickles and tahina. 

Maybe get just a side of falafel?

Very good and very fancy new South Indian restaurant. We got a ton of food, and spent a lot of money. But you could get by for a lot cheaper. 

The menu changes frequently by the sounds of it, so dunno if this will be useful, but what we really liked were the: **chutney palette**, **rasam poori** (basically the best version of pani poori I've ever had), the **asparagus parippu urundai** which had this thick, green melon-seed gravy. **dosa** (make sure to get it without ghee), and some of the **vegetable of the day** dishes (it comes with 3). The only thing we didn't really like was the crispy sambal peppers which sounded great but were pretty boring.

To do it cheap, just get the vegetable of the day. You get 3 dishes so it's fairly good value. Or just get a drink and the chutney palette, it's a crazy nice place just for the bar.

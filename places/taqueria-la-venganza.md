Extremely good vegan mexican food in an arcade bar. The whole menu is vegan, with many different fake meats that they make themselves. We went for 3 different **tacos** which were all very delicious. At the time they had 6 options but by the looks of it I think they rotate their menu regularly. We got the cauliflower, carnitas, and carne con chili rojo, all of which were great and very saucy. We liked the **cauliflower** the best. Honestly we wish we woulda got the other three options as well. It costed us like $16 for three, but they are large. We opted for tacos to get the variety, but you can get more bang for your buck if you get the nachos or burritos.

The experience is just picking it up like a takeaway but within the Emporium arcade bar. You can also get pints of local beer for around $11 (including tax and tip), which are very tasty. 

They sell their meats as well by the bag and I believe to other vendors. I wish them a lot of success.

I'm sure you know how hard it is to find a Korean place with vegan options, let alone a good one. This place has plenty of vegan options that are clearly marked, and the dishes come with a bunch of sides that they make vegan too.

I got a **mushroom sundubu jigae** (silken tofu stew). It warmed me to my soul. It's so tasty, and there's plenty of silky tofu and mushrooms and other good stuff in a tasty broth. I highly recommend this place. They also have a bunch of drinks.

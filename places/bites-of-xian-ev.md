Same deal as [Bites of Xi'an](/places/bites-of-xian) in Downtown Brooklyn. Not too many vegan options but they're tasty and legit. I got the **cold skin noodles** (liangpi) and **veggie dumplings**. Pretty good all round the board. The noodles were saucy, springy and tasty. Good stuff at a very good price. You only need the noodles as a meal and it's under 9 bucks. As they say in Xi'an: Very nice!

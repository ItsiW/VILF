Warning, this is a pop-up so won't be here regularly. But by god if this isn't a set of the tastiest tacos I've had in my life. I got the **smoked mushroom** and **kabocha squash** (substitute for rockfish) tacos. They were prepared on the gril fresh, and loaded with toppings and salsas. Juicy af. The mushrooms were woody and chewy but like in a good way. One was with a wheat tortilla, the other with a corn tortilla that they made on the spot.

10/10. I ended up paying $16 including tips and tax for the two... and I get that it's waaay up there in the taco economy. But I'd say the value is there.

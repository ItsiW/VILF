Finally, a kosher vegetarian pickle themed fast food restaurant.

I got their signature fried pickles, made from pickles from [The Pickle Guys](/places/the-pickle-guys) next door (which you should definitely visit). They were ok, not amazing. But the **tacos**. The tacos were really good. Probably the best tacos I've had in the city. It was chocked full of some mince (based on the other menu items I think it's made with Beyond mince), and it's spiced up so good. Well done. 2 of them for like $11 after tax.

They've also got vegan burgers and sausages and drinks.

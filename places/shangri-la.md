I'm so impressed with this place. I'd describe the cuisine as "healthy vegan," but don't let that conjure images of dry quinoa bowls and wheatgrass juice. It's simple, well-prepared, vegetable-forward fare. Each day they do a **set plate** with roughly five items plus soup. I believe there's some history of Tibetan ownership/chefs, and some of the dishes definitely seem influenced by that region. However, on balance, Shangri-La isn't a Tibetan restaurant. The set plate tonight was: mixed veggie soup (tasted like lentil); short brown rice; yellow split peas with onions and garlic; stir-fry with carrot, zucchini, cauliflower, and broccoli; collard greens with shiitake mushroom onion sauce; and a mixed salad with beets, lemon juice, and agave dressing. The **collard greens and mushroom sauce** were particularly amazing and even the rice was flavorful enough to be eaten entirely on its own. The price is a little on the high end ($17/plate), but I found it very filling and worth the cost. Someone who is less of a pig could probably have turned it into two meals. There are also locations on Linden St in Oakland and on San Pablo Ave in Albany.

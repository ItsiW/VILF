This is extremely tasty Chinese food. A lot of things are standards that are executed really well. My favourites are the **jelly noodles**, **stir-fried sour shredded potato**, **fungus with vinegar salad**, and the **chinese onion pancake** which is actually a loaf of bread.

(btw we found out the dumplings are not actually vegan).

Should be around $20 a head, it's not crazy expensive.

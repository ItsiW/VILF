This is a fancy little cafe/wine bar on Orchard St. I got the fried **cauliflower pita**, it was nice and light, but nothing too special. A bit pricey at $11 before tips and tax, but the vibe is very nice for a little sit down and coffee.

Next time I want to go for their late afternoon happy hour which has baba ghanoush, muhammara, and $8 glasses of fancy wine.

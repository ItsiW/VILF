Yummy **dosa** get it in me. 

Portions: enormous. Really crispy outside and fluffyish inside. It's a bit oily but that's the price we pay for the crisp. Nice thick sambar. The chutneys didn't blow my mind but were tasty. I got the sweet potato filling which wasn't my favourite but I knew it was an experimental choice. I'd get the regular potato masala and maybe a mysore/gunpowder addition to make it a bit spicier.

It was around $17 after tip and tax for the dosa. They've got $6 Indian beers.

Also they've got a wide selection of curries I've never heard of before so I'll definitely be back.

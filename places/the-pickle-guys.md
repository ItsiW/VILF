I don't have a photo for this one buy you can look it up, it's just barrels and barrels of **pickled stuff** at a reasonable enough price.

You can buy by various sized containers, or just get single items in small plastic bags. I got a sour pickle, a chilli pickle, a pickled green tomato (delicious) and a small container of pickled cherry tomatos which were also fantastic. But they've got so much more like other kinds of pickles, pickled fruits and vegetables, peppers, olives. Just so many barrels.

This place might not be for you if you don't like pickles.

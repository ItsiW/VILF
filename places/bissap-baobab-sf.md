Vibes are whacky and funâ„¢. It's more of an event space than a restaurant, so great if you're looking to hear a band and sit at an indoor table under an umbrella.

We got the **Yassa** (like a bbq onion sauce) and **Okra stew**, both of which are very tasty. Make sure if you get the salad you insist that it comes without the mayonnaise dressing... that wasn't very good or vegan. Mains are like $20 each with tips and tax.

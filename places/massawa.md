Really good food here, great option to take non-vegans to, especially if they've never had Ethiopian food before. The only available **share platters** are the vegan ones, so that's the way to go. You get a big selection of different veggies and lentils with as much injera as you want to eat it with, it's all really flavourful. Good drinks too.

It's on the pricier end, but a platter for 3 can feed 4 people for around $80 after tax and tips. 

It gets phenominal value IF you go on a sunday night, when jazz players from Jiulliard and the Manhattan School of Music put on free shows in the restaurant. It's a good night out.

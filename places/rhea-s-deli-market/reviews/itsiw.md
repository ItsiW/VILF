Little corner store with a sandwich counter. They've got a bunch of veggie sandwiches they can make vegan, and then you can sit at the counter and watch the street. I got the **vegetarian steak sandwich** vegan, pretty juicy fake meat and a nice sandwich experience. They recently got in [Prime Roots](https://www.primeroots.com/) options, which I think are the best vegan deli meats around currently.

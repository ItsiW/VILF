This is an all-vegan Bolivian place. We went on a wednesday night, and by the looks of it it was quiet, but normally they have a live band and stuff, the place looks fun. So maybe it's worth going for the entertainment.

The food wasn't that interesting, a lot of simple stuff that you could whip up at home.

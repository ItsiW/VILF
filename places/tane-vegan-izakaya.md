This is the sibling restaurant of [Shizen](/places/shizen), pretty much the same vegan sushi menu with different names of stuff. There's a bunch of things that are great including the **brussel sprouts** and some of the **rolls** (I forget which ones are the good ones). There's some pretty meh stuff too even though it looks pretty. 

But god damn you need to have a meal first before coming here, it is pricey as hell for what you get. Forgot how much it was but it's a lot. Like one of those roll plates with a few pieces on it is more than $20 after tips and tax.

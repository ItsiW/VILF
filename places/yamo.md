A delightful diner with excelent value for money. The food isn't amazing, but it gets you with the vibe. There's one person taking orders and one old lady making the food. Quick in and out with dishes costing about $10 with tips and tax. I liked the **tea salad** more than the curry and noodles we got, not that they were bad, and you can really jazz things up with the chilli. Veggie items are clearly marked, and they can go through what they can make vegan, there's quite a bit.

Extremely Greek venue with extremely Greek servers. The **fava** here is great. It's a yellow split pea dip. We also got some **zucchini and eggplant chips** (without tzatziki). Theres a bunch of other mezzes you can get, make sure to request without dairy though.

We got some tsipouro and they have a heavy pour. Great stuff, and the venue is very lovely.

An institution of an old-style diner in the Mission. We got **Nicky's Polenta** and **Soyrizo hash & tofu**. And a side of decent guac. And unlimited filter coffee. It was $31.66 after tip and tax each, so not crazy value, but good old timey vibes and I assume good when hungover. I don't get to get to diners much so this is nice.

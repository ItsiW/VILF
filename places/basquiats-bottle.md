A cool bar in Bed-Stuy with a mexican menu. The **Citrus Seitan Tacos** are very meaty and satisfying, great with the pickled onions. Definitely on the pricier end at $16 for 3 but undeniably good bar food. 

I'd come more for the cocktails. They're very reasonably priced and it's a limited menu of specials that they make.

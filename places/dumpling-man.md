This is a handmade dumpling place, they've got a counter where you can see all of them being made. I got the **vegan wontons** which were the vegan special that week and the **cold noodles**. I was a little underwhelmed, which is a shame because this should be great in theory.The wontons kinda fell apart and neither the filling or the sauce had too much flavour. The cold noodles were kinda just too salty and didn't love the noodle choice.

Update: I went back and got the **corn and quinoa soup** and the pan fried veggie dumplings. Very filling but just not that good. The wrapper is nice and hearty but the filling, although packed in, is kinda flavourless. I wanna like this place but it's a no from me.

Keep in mind that it takes a while for the orders to come out because everything is made fresh, and there is sadly a lot of plastic involved.

This is a Hong Kong style cafe with Chinese lunches and Chinese-Western items like spaghetti and "Italian chicken". Given the name, I also wouldn't be surprised if it was a gambling den. It was exclusively populated by old Chinese men staring at the tv.

They had one vegan option, the mapo tofu, it's a different style to what you might be used too, clear sauce that's still spicy, and filled with sweet pickled vegetables. It's not amazing but does the job for lunch and comes with free tea in a mug. I paid $15 all up.

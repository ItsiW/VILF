This is an Ethiopian/Eritrean restaurant with a bewildering vibe. I went on a Monday night and it was pretty much empty. The lights were on full and a tacky Ethiopian music video was playing loudly on a giant screen. 10/10.

I got the **Veggie Combo** which comes with like 6 dishes, salad and a bunch of injera. It came out lightning fast which was a bad sign, and I know that for these places they must make huge batches well in advance, but it came out kinda cold, which was a shame because it was very tasty. Not the best of these dishes I've had but very solid.

I paid $23 all up with tax and tips, and it was one of the rare occasions it was big enough for me to take some home with me. Probably this and a starter would be big enough for two.

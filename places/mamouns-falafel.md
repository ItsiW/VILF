I heard a lot about this place being good and it's actually very good. I got a **falafel** and **baba ganouj** sandwich and it was cheap, good quality green baba ganouj, good flavour from the falafel and fillings. You can also just get these as sides, 4 falafels, a pot of dip and bread will cost you $6 cash, outstanding. 

The vegan options (of which there are many) are much cheaper than the non-vegan ones, which I love to see.

I got the lentil soup too which isn't amazing, but that's not why you're here.

I look forward to coming back here soon, hopefully while extremely intoxicated to fit in with the tourists and students checking out boomer comics complaining about their wives at the Comedy Cellar next door.

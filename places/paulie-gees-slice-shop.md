I don't like pizza that much but this is good. Very crispy bottom and nice bready middle and a huge portion for $5 (inc. tax iirc), hand for scale. I got the **vegan special** or something, I forgot the name but it's not on the regular menu. They've got a bunch of different vegan pizza options. this one had a bunch of different vegan sub stuff and pepper sauce and caramelized onions.

All in all, good topings on good bread. I'm still not a pizza convert.

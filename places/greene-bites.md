Guys the **vegan chopped cheese** here is fucked. It is such a greasy, rich experience. I haven't had anything like it in my 6 years of veganism. Like I likely won't be getting it again in a while because it's not what I normally go for, but wowee. I assume this is a very accurate approximation to a regular chopped cheese. At $12 for roll and $14 for hero it's too expensive for a deli sandwich but you should get it anyway.

Is it just me? Is this a normal thing that's available at other places?

I'll try everything else and report back.

- Reuben: not amazing, wouldn't go for it

Cheap Italian spot (around $12 a dish). You'd think for somewhere in the East Village they'd have a vegan option nailed but no. They had no explicitly vegan items, but you can sub things. There really aren't that many options once you do that, in the end and I just got red sauce with eggplant and mushrooms. If you go, make sure you don't get the fresh pasta (they have egg), stick to the dried shapes.

Now you and I both know that you and I can make better pasta at home, it's almost never better out because people generally have no clue how to make good vegan pasta. Putting that aside for a second just to focus on specific flaws, god damn people need to cook with more salt. When you normally make pasta, you add a shit ton of cheese. Cheese is salty and fatty. So when you make vegan versions of things, you normally have to compensate by adding more salt and fat, either just putting more in or or via some other ingredient. They didn't compensate so it was really bland. I've never asked for salt in a restaurant in my life before now.

This is a ramen spot that has a vegan option, their **spicy curry ramen**. Disclaimer: I don't love Japanese curry, I think it tends to be pretty one-note. So this ramen was fine for me, but not exceptional. Nice noodles, a lot of toppings (that honestly got in the way of the noodle experience). Very hearty all in all, and I paid a bit over $20 after tip and tax.

I'm giving this place a something going for it just because it's the only **zaatar bread** place I can find near where I go. It's not the best I've had (I miss you [Man'ousheh Grand](https://thegoodtaste.guide/places/manousheh-grand/) and [A1 Bakery](a1bakery.com.au/)) but what are you gonna do. The cardamom cold brew they have is very tasty though.

It costed like $12 once you include tip and tax for the zaatar if you want to include some veggies on the top. I'd go back to try the other dishes, they look pretty.

Really good Middle Eastern food. We got a literal feast, and a bottle of Palestinian wine. Between 4 of us it costed $35 a head including tax and tip. Good value for what we got. 

Stand-outs were the **batata harra**, **house pita with spices**, and **hamleh** (fresh chickpeas that are charred in their shells). Although everything else we got was also good including the falafel, muhamara, baba ghanoush and ful.

You can get a solid **banh mi** here. Wouldn't go out of my way for it but it's pretty good. Crunchy bread and all the pickled spicy fillings. They've got quite a few vegan options, I got recommended the tofu which was really silky but not very flavourful. Might go for the mushroom or fake chicken option next time. 

All in all, good option if you want banh mi.

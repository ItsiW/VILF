The same menu as [Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodles II](/places/tasty-hand-pulled-noodles-ii) (I don't know why I'm surprised, this is my bad). But you know what it's not as good. Similarly the noodle quality isn't as good as you can get at other places like [Hana Noodle Station](/places/hana-noodle-station) or [DunHuang Miss Noodles](/places/dunhuang-miss-noodles), here it's a bit mushier than chewy. And the pan fried preparation isn't amazing. 

Also got the pan fried dumplings, and the veggie version is just kinda raw cabbage filling... not the best.

There's better in the area!

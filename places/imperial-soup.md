This is a little Chinese lunch spot. They've got one vegan thing on the menu which is rice with a topping of either **vegan fish and broccoli** or mixed mushroom. The whole thing is steamed in a lot of lotus leaf, which gives it a lovely smell.

The vegan fish is really good, I think it's one from Layonna. Has a nice chew and they have it with a teriyaki sauce. The broccoli didn't do much for me and the rice to topping ratio was way off in general. I think this is the makings of a great dish but misses the mark. Definitely needs more sauce for the amount of rice. I'll go back to try the mushroom version.

I paid $14 all up, I think it's good value and they put a lot of care in.

UPDATE: went back for the mushroom version, it's a little bland but ok. I preferred the vegan fish one.

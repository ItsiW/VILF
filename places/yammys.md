I am a simple man, give me a big plate of Ethiopian food and I am happy.

You can get a **mixed vegan plate** for ~$16 including tips and tax, it's a very big portion so I had leftovers. It's good food, but also I've preferred some other ones around, so only gets SGFI for that reason... Ethiopian food has a very high bar because it's usually very good and I love variety.

I was very drunk and this place is a fever dream of a venue. Come for the Thai standards, stay for the water feature and shared pod urinal.

Plenty of vegan options, tasty big portions of all your regular Thai restaurant foods you know and love. And they can do everything with a mock duck that is fine. 

We got the red curry and some noodle thing I don't quite remember the name of but yummy!

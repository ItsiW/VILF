This is a trendy vaguely Asian inspired vegan restaurant. The food is good but it's *very* expensive, and in my mind not worth the price tag. 

We got the **udon noodles** in truffle cream, extremely creamy (although we wish they had some bread or something to sop up the sauce), the **bao sliders** which were quite tasty, the **general d's cauliflower** whichwere tasty but I wish were crunchier/crispier and the crispy gyoza, which were not better than any average gyoza.

It ended up being around $150 all up for 2 people (including tips and tax). With that we did get a bottle of wine because they're half price on wednesdays. I think it's too much for something that isn't completely amazing. But I'm glad vegan restaurants like this are being successful.

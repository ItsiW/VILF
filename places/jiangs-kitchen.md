This is a Xinjiang Chinese spot. Not too many vegan options, but they've got a big stire fried noodle section where you can get variouus rice or handmade wheat noodles. I got the **rice noodles with traditional sauce** which was pretty solid. I'd definitely go for the wheat noodles next time though, these got a little soggy.

They've also got a bunch of appetizers like a minced tofu, eggplant with garlic, cucumbers, etc. Keen to go back and try them.

A market AND a Persian take-away joint. We got a range of mains and sides, on the vegan end they have **ghormeh sabzi** which had a very collared greens vibe, and **fesenjan** (like a sweet, pasty walnut-pomegranate sauce), with some roasted tomato and eggplant sides. I paid $19 all up for my share.

Trying new things was fun, but I got the feeling that the mains were usually in support of meat, and they didn't really give any substitute. All in all pretty good though, and the market itself has a good selection of stuff to browse while you wait.

Back into the hellscape of Dekalb Market Hall. The things I do for you.

So this pierogi place, they have exactly one vegan thing on the menu, **roasted beet salad**, which is a small side for $4 + tax. They have a big label on it saying that it's vegan. I don't know why they have it. What idiot would go to a pierogi place and be like "oh the only thing they have is beet salad, I guess I'll get that", in the middle of a food hall with tons of options. Me, that's who. I am clearly the sole market for the vegan advertising for this place. 

It's fine. It's beet salad. It's not amazing, it's not bad. It's a bit sweet from some apples or some shit. If you really want a smallish portion of beet salad for like $5, get it. Leave me alone.

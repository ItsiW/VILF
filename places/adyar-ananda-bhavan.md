This is a vegetarian South Indian restaurant. They've got a very large selection, I got one of the lunch deals which was a **masala dosa** with an idli, vada, sambar, 3 chutneys and a mango desert.


It's all decent, but not the tastiest I've had. My friend got a thali with a lot of different curries which was pretty good too. All in all a solid place with a lot of choices.

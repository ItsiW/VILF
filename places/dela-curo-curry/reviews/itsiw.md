This is a Japanese curry place. They have a vegan black curry, it's nice with good veggies and a charry gravy, but I haven't found myself wanting to go back. It was a little one-note by the end. I guess a nice lunch, costed a little under $16 with tax and tip included. That being said I don't tend to love Japanese curry so take it with a grain of salt.

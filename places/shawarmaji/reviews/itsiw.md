ALERT: GOOD FALAFEL PLACE. This a Jordanian place. I got the **falafel pita**, it was excellent. good amount of veggies and pickles. And god damn the **toum** they make is exceptional. 

Also finally somewhere that makes something snack sized and not like 2-meal-big-burrito sized. It was a little under $11 after tax and tip.

This ain't a restaurant, it's a middle eastern importer/grocery shop. Lots of the good stuff, including pack-your-own olives from big buckets. Especially good is the **muhammara** and **chili sauce** though I forgot what that ones name is. They have plenty of bread and little sweets and etc. etc. it's very good you should go, we got a feast for under $30 that got eaten by a lot of people.

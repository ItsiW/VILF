They have one **vegan shoyu ramen** which is pretty good. It's a soy sauce based broth, and it's nice to find an option which isn't just miso for once. It feels very refined, all the elements are nice but I didn't find any of it outstanding. I probably wouldn't end up getting it again for the $16 price.

Fair warning, the servers here are extremely friendly so make sure you're in the mood for that.

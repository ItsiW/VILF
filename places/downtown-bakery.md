Mexican place with a bunch of different options. They put some vegan things on there like tamales and tacos that I got, but seems like they did it without too much thought. They're fine but not too flavourful. The price and serving sizes are alright, you defintely don't need all this for a meal.

An efficient way to get from not full to full.

For 3 bucks you can get some cheung fun steamed **rice noodle rolls** made right in front of you. Great value for money. You get a good portion with scallions some soy and peanut sauce. Hits the spot.

A lot of restaurants in the area make it so not sure who makes it best, or who has better vegan options.

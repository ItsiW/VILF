This is one of the best value places in the city. There's tons of different **veggie tapas** dishes like **artichokes**, **pimientos de padron** (like shishitos), and **patatas bravas**. You get complimentary bread and bravas sauce. 

Each dish is $6-8 bucks and not that small. The wines and sangria are around the same price. All of it's great.

You can easily walk out at under $20 a head including drinks and a few dishes.

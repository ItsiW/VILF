This is quite honestly the best **udon soup** I've had since going vegan. The broth takes me right back. I've found it's not too common for udon places to have vegan options, and here they have a bunch. I got the sensai udon which came with mountain vegetables. Also the place is fairly cheap, I think I paid around $12.

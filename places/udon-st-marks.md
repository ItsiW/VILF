This is quite honestly the best **udon soup** I've had since going vegan. The broth takes me right back. I've found it's not too common for udon places to have vegan options, and here they have a bunch.

I've had the sensai udon which came with mountain vegetables. ALso been back and had the veggie tempura set (which they double checked was vegan). Comes with a mountain of veggie tempura. A bowl is around $12 and a set is around $18 with tips and tax included.

Got here pretty drunk because I got sick of going to that mexican food truck on Bedford & N 7th. They have a bunch of vegan options but just one vegan slice **V for Vegan** (I think). It was fine. They put it in the oven and it had a crispy bottom. Like $5ish. Yeah, fine. I'll probably get it again if I've been drinking and want a snack.

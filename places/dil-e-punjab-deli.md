Currently my least favourite of the Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi delis. But it's still legit and alright and open late and they've got tons of vegan options so who's complaining. The bread's a bit doughy though and very re-heated.

$9 cash for a **plate** with two options, rice, and bread â€” pretty good.

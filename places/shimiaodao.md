This place does big warming bowls of Yunnan rice noodles. The lady there said there were a few they could make vegan, I got the **spicy noodle**. Make sure you get it without egg or fish tofu.

Very delicious, like $16 after tax and tips. Normally I like wheat noodles for hearty soups, but the rice noodles in this are great, the thick round kind.

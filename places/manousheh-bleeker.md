This place is excellent. I've been dying for a good spinach triangle (**fatayer**) in this city, and this did not disappoint. Made fresh to order from a large hot oven as god intended. This one as you can see was on the more on the cancerous side of well done in parts, but I like that. The filling is like a acidic oniony spinach it's very good. Honestly one of the best versions of this I've had. I got a side of **muhammara** which was unecessary but very nice. And on top of that a **$2 arabic coffee**. You can't ask for much more. If you go for breakfast they even give you the coffee for free. They also have affordable Lebanese beers and wines.

Looking at the online menu with the pictures, I think I made a good call. I'd stick to the classics like zaatar, fatayer, and a side of pickles and olives.

Keep in mind this is slow food. It's made fresh. 15 minutes or so to make it. I'm sure when it gets busy it'll take a while. I went in the late afternoon when there was no one else there. This place is for sitting and relaxing, enjoying your coffee while you wait for your fresh bread to be made and cool down.

I will take this moment to have a rant about the **Italian Tax**. This is the what I call the effect where similar items from different cultures are charged different amounts. Pasta always costs more than Chinese noodles, despite their similarity and similar effort. Pizza costs way more than other fresh baked food like naan and spinach triangles. There is nothing less artisinal about this place. I enjoy that these foods I like far more than Western food are cheap, but it's still a shame. It seems that some cultures are allowed to be expensive (mostly Western and Japanese), and others have to remain cheap. Next time you think you want pizza, go to a good Lebanese bakery instead.

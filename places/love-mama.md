This is a Malaysian/Thai/Vietnamese restaurant. Usually that would usually mean it's so broad that it's all bad, but what I got was pretty decent. I got the **vegetarian curry clay pot**. It came out disturbingly quickly but I don't think it's just instant stuff, the curry had a bunch of whole spices in it, and was pretty tasty. If you like Japanese curry you'd probably like this.

A reminder that tasty **vegan tacos** can be done. I got one with beyond meat and one with mushrooms. Both good. I paid $11.27 all up, so on the pricier side of the taco spectrum. 

UPDATE: The score for this one had to be lowered in the presence of [Taqueria La Venganza](/places/taqueria-la-venganza) across the road which is so good. The beyond taco here is still worth going for though.

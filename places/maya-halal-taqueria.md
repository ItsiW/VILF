This is a halal Mexican place, which means for sure the refried beans don't have lard. Huzzah. 

A few vegan options, I got the **potato flautas** (stuffed and deep fried tortillas). Pretty tasty, along with all the beans, rice, usual sides. And tasty salsas. With a hibiscus agua fresca the whole thing came to a bit under $20 with tips and tax.

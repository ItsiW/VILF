This place has Henanese food and makes a kind of noodle called **huimei**. They're this wide hand-pulled noodle. I got it with veggies in a veggie broth. It's pretty good, nice chew on the noodles. Broth isn't amazing but nice. Next time I'd try one of the dry fried variations.

I also got a plate of mixed appetizers, the triple salad comes with their homemade kelp salad, cucumber salad and their vegetarian chicken which seems to be compressed blocks of layered tofu skins (seen in the soup as well). Pretty tasty.

Each dish is like $9 after tips and tax, so fairly good value.

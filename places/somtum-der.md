I tried this place once takeaway and it was really good, so I went back with a friend and boy oh boy is this place fantastic. It's a Thai restaurant that focuses on salads made by the mortar and pestle. Things are so incredibly flavourful and bright and herby. I recommend getting a bunch of salads and sticky rice, you'll need a few dishes because they're all pretty small. It costs about $15-$20 a dish, but it is good value because of just how good it is.

Papaya salad (somtum) is one of my favourite foods in the world, but it can be hard to find vegan ones because normally they put in fish sauce. However this place has put in effort to give a good vegan selection.

We got the **vegetarian papaya salad**, **mushroom larb**, and **impossible larb**. All were fantastic and quite different from each other. The papaya was refreshing, the mushrooms were so herby and tangy, and the impossible larb was so rich and tasty. Get all 3. I think they've got a couple other vegan dishes too.

Be warned, this stuff is truly spicy. Like seriously hot. But incredible. The **grilled coconut sticky rice skewers** are good to wash it down, along with beer.

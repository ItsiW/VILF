I've been meaning to go to this Thai place for a while. Papaya salad (somtum) is one of my favorite foods in the world, but it's hard to make well vegan because of it's reliance on fish sauce. However this place has a whole bunch of vegan thai salads.

I wasn't so hungry so just got a **mushroom larb** (larb hed kao kuo) and **grilled coconut sticky rice skewers**. It's a bit of a pricey place at $20 before tax and very small portions but damn it tastes good. Super spicy and sour and herby and delicious salad. The skewers weren't overly coconuty, pretty tasty but I'd probably just go for regular sticky rice next time. Or maybe they're better fresh off the grill when you eat in.

I'm keen to go back to try their many other salads, including veggie papaya salad, and larb made with impossible meat. I assume their standard Thai noodle dishes are good too, but c'mon that's not why you're going here. Branch out a little. Get a salad.

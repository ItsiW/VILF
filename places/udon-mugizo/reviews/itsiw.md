Wow, yummy **udon** you must be thinking. Well they've got one vegan option and it's ok, a cold one. Looks pretty though.

It's pretty much what it looks like on the packet. Fresh udon, radish, scallions and some soy meat, and a light broth to go on it.

Idk good on a hot day?? A Bit satisfying?

For $25 after tips and tax idk on this one.

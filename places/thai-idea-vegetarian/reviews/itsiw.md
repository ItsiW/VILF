Oof I'm so sad this place ain't good because I love fake meat places. Got the "chicken" larb and volcano "beef". Neither were very good... either in flavor or texture. The beef thing came with the worst onion ring I've ever had, super doughy. The peanut sauce we got on the side and the crab cake starter were ok.

We paid over $30 a head after tips and tax.

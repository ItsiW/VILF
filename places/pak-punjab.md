It's a deli that also has bain maries of various curries and stuff.

These guys do deliver, but I think the game here is to rock up a bit late after a few drinks and wait for a bit too long behind some old men to get some pretty legit and oily saag and dahl for some amount of money he makes up on the spot but still isn't that expensive. Good stuff.

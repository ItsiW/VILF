Went for the new Beyond Meat orange chicken. There's no reason to get this. It's just ok, no different to other vegan nuggets/meat substitutes you can get at any other vegan Asian restaurant. You'd be better off spending your money somewhere that isn't a chain that profits so much off the exploitation of animals. Leave going here for if you're on a roadtrip and Panda Express it the only thing you can find. And it's a pretty small serving for $11 all up.

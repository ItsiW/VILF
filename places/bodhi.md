This is a fun and interesting vegan kosher dim sum restaurant. You can tell they put a lot of time and effort into the preparation of everything. The **handmade noodle beef soup** was really good, and we also tried a bunch of dim sum like the baked meat bun, and some others. The quality was high but none of them were super exceptional on their own, I guess it's more about enjoying the variety. The fried dumplings were bad.

Don't confuse it with the more publicised *Original Buddha Bodai Kosher Vegetarian Restaurant*. From the signage it kinda looks like it was originally an offshoot of that one but has since changed.

If you go before 4pm all the dim sum are a dollar cheaper each.

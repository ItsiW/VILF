This is a humble Middle Eastern restaurant where you can order a bunch of small things which is good. Honestly, I wouldn't get the falafel or zaatar here, but I liked the **cauliflower**, and I'd go back to try little bits of other stuff, dips n shit. And it's fairly cheap. I paid $15 including tax and tips for all this stuff, so pretty good.

This is like the go-to fancy schmancy **fine dining** vegan restaurant. By far, this is the most I've ever spent on a meal in my life. Lots of creative stuff and whatnot. You pay $90 + tax (tip included) and get 5-7 courses. Things are very tasty and inventive. Pictured was my favorite one, a Nashville fried beetroot. I think the menu changes regularly. 

Was it tasty and fun, sure. Is it worth over $100?? Not sure. Depends how much you like inventive food. I guess you need to approach it more as an experience than a meal. I wouldn't rush back, but I can see why people value it, and I'm glad I've tried it once in my life.

B&H Dairy is an old-school **Jewish Diner**. Everything is vegetarian, with quite a few vegan options. They have a large assortment of **soups** that I believe they're well-know for, most of which are vegan. There's also other stuff and you can see all the menu deals on laminated pages around the walls. Ask when you get there what's vegan.

I got the chile and soup combo which was way too much food for around $16 after tips and tax. Everything is sitting there ready to go so it's great for a quick meal.

In retrospect, why the hell did I pick veggie chile? I went for retro Jewish food. I'll be honest I panicked in the moment. Shoulda got the cabbage rolls. 

Chile was ok, borscht was actually pretty good. I'll be back to try some of the other stuff. 

I'll be honest though, not sure how I'd think of this place if I wasn't in it for the Jewish nostalgia.

This is a food truck that normally has a few people waiting in line. They've got a few vegan options including the **mushroom empanada**. It's $3 cash. It's probably been sitting out for a few hours but is still pretty flakey and not too oily. The mushrooms are nice and it comes with quite a vibrant green hot sauce that really overpowers the rest of it so no worries.

Definitely worth it for a snack. For something more filling they've also got a bean empanada, and various tacos and burritos. I'm sure a lot of it can be made vegan.

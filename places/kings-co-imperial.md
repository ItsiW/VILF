Very confusing name but very good food. At first I thought it was a pub but turns out it's a Chinese restaurant. Everything we had here was great, although they probably oversold us on the portions and then we were pretty drunk so forgot the leftovers which is the only reason I'm rating the value down.

They can make a lot of the menu items vegan, and we got the **wok seared pea shoots** which were garlicy, smoky and delicious, the **dan dan noodles** made vegan, which were really saucy and spicy, big fan, and a special **kung pao carrot** they had on with tofu, which wasn't my favourite but it's my own fault for ordering kung pao stuff, I still don't get it. But it was still good.

Anyway great stuff, great vibe, and probably a more approachable price if you don't order too much.

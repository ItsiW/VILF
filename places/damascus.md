A Middle Eastern grocer next to the more famous [Sahadi's](/places/sahadis). There were a lot of people speaking Arabic coming through here which was a good sign.

The spinach triangle they had here wasn't as good as the ones next door, a bit doughy and less flavoursome. But they have a lot of prepared tubs of various dips and salads, and great looking breads. Their **baba ganoush** is smokey and chunky, really good.

They've got some vegan pastries too. I don't have much of a sweet tooth but it seems to be pretty good quality.

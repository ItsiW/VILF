New York Chinese food is generally terrible. This is not. I missed actually good handmade noodles. I asked one of the servers what they could do vegan and he said they could do the **Huangcheng Cold Noodle** but hot. Very good. They're quite irregular so have different amounts of chew throughout. Light on the veg but very nutty and rich sauce on the bottom. And I think I paid like $14 all up including tips and tax.

The other server told me next time they could do the signature Chongqing Street Noodle vegan as long as they remove the meat and broth, and they said it's pretty good. I'll check it out and report back.

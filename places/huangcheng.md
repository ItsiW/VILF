New York Chinese food is generally terrible. This is not. I missed actually good handmade noodles. I asked one of the servers what they could do vegan and he said they could do the **Huangcheng Cold Noodle**, a kind of sesame noodle, but hot. Very good. They're quite irregular so have different amounts of chew throughout. Light on the veg but very nutty and rich sauce on the bottom. And I think I paid like $14 all up including tips and tax.

UPDATE: This place is still excellent, some of the best sesame noodles I've ever had. Went again and got the **cucumber salad** and **potato salad** which were both excellent as well with their chilli oil. Definitely enough for two people with the sesame noodles.

Finally some great Palestinian food. They got all the hits. Big mix plate of stuff, **fried eggplant and cauliflower**, good **baba ganoush**, and a mix of ful and hummus called **qudsiah** which was excellent. Chips, pickles, everything was good. Excited to go back.

We got far too much food between 3 people (as shown) and with coffee and stuff it came to $30 a head including tips and tax.

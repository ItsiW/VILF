New South Indian street food spot. I was excited to try one of the wraps but the bread is not vegan. The only option is a gobi manchurian and rice plate. It's good... but god damn is it bad bang for buck. You only get a tiny amount of gobi. It was $23.80 after tax and tip for this and a mint lemonade.

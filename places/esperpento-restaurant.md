This place sells a lot of tapas, but like the kind that isn't too bougie. It's like "ok let's take this vegetable and fry it with a bit of olive oil and garlic" and that's pretty much every dish. Sure it's tasty but yeah you can make it at home for sure. Peppers and artichokes were particularly tasty.

Ended up being $73 for two of us, with a drink each. So not stunning value.

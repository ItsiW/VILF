UC is an adorable Chinese dessert shop. From their menu:

```Life is sometimes hard. When you see something beautiful, you'll forget all the stress you have, so comes the name UC Dessert.```

The server indicated that although the menu had a lot of "no milk" products, many still contain butter. I got the **sesame paste with tofu pudding**. Very globby starch paste with black sesame flavour, tasty but not my favorite. 

They also have little mochi balls in syrup, but he couldn't tell me the ingredients. He explained that they sourced them from an old lady nearby who refused to give up any information about her proprietary recipe, much to my and the health authority's dismay.

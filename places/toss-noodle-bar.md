This place allows the CUSTOMER to select their own combination of noodle, sauce, and ingredients. I stand fully against this.

However, what I got was tasty. I got **fried rice noodles** in spicy sauce with tofu. It had that smoky wok hei flavor and did the trick. It costed $16.50 with tips and tax.

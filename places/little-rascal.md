These guys have pretty good vegan Turkish options. Not really outstanding, but solid and you can't go wrong, and served with hot turkish bread. The problem is that it's pretty expensive to get enough that will fill you up. The **artichoke hearts** were really good but it's only two pieces and like $15.

What was really good though was the **lentil soup** for $10. I would go back again just for that. I believe it is a Turkish version called Ezogelin Çorbası made with mint and some peppers, and you can find a [recipe on my site](https://itsiweinstock.com/recipes/EzogelinCorbasi.pdf) although mine isn't super authentic (but very tasty).

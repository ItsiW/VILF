The city's finest Kosher Israeli and Sushi restaurant. We got **hummus and falafel**, fries and baba ganoush. The falafel were on the better side of things, very green and crispy. The hummus was nice enough. Probably everything's better wrapped up in a pita.

Baba ganoush was bad. Fries were fries.

Damn this place is good. It was bordering on a phenomenal rating but there were a couple misses.

They've got a vegan menu so ask for that. Highly recommend getting the **sichuan cabbage** and the **chiuchow olive green beans**, probably one of the best things I've had in the bay. We went with 4 people and had to reorder a few things because there's not thaaat many vegan options, all the ones they have are small. But it's very good.

Always ALWAYS ask if they make the falafel themselves. I have been burnt so many times from pictures. This food truck had falafel on rice, kinda just minced up prepurchased falafel with rice and spice and onion. Truly just an efficient way to go from hungry to full for $8 cash.

If you must get it (because it may be the only thing open in the area at some given time), just make sure to order it without the white sauce which is mayo based.

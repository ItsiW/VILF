A Taiwanese choose your own adventure of **braised ingredients on noodles**, basically everything is cooked up together in this spiced broth. You pick out the ingredients you want, each $2.50, like cabbage, various mushrooms, veg, kinds of tofu, and select a noodle for it to all go with. I just went for plain wheat noodle and 4 other things, (mushies x 2, cabbage, tofu).

You can mark of vegetarian on the sheet they give you, and I checked it's vegan. The broth is satisfying and salty. All in all a good option if you want noodles.

Great **Ethiopian platters** at about $20 a head. There's 7 different options and you can pick 5 per person. All comes with injera. Extremely tasty and the lady running the place was lovely. We also got the Timatim Fitfit appetizer which is all these veggies spiced and with shreds of injera soaking in it, it's really tasty.

They also have good drinks!

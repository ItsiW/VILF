This is a solid clasic **banh mi**. nice pickles, crispy exterior baguette, silky tofu. They've added in some saucy mushrooms as well. It's not going to blow you away but it's good when you want a banh mi.

I still paid like $13 for it so pricy for a medium size sandwich I'd say.

I went back and got the papaya salad. Papaya salad is always nice but this was on the lower end of the spectrum.

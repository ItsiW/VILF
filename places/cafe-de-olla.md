This is a fantastic place. They have vegan **tamales**, a few kinds including sometime some vegan specials. I think a few of the other options like the Memelas can be made vegan too. The salsas are top notch.

They have a bunch of spiced coffees and mexican hot chocolates that they can do vegan.

It's just so nice to sit outside here and have a little lunch. The prices are good too, around $6 for a tamale with tax and tip.

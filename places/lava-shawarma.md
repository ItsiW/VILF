I've been looking for a Middle Eastern place like this in New York for a while. Affordable **meza plates** done well. I got a mixed plate that came with a few things. I got lentil soup too (but that wasn't so good).

I think the way to approach this place is to come with a few friends on a sunny day and order a bunch of mezas and sides. Everything I had was homemade and high quality. Great baba ganouj and tasty falafel. I also took home some maqdous, which is small eggplants stuffed with walnuts in a slightly spicy olive oil marinade. They put a lot of care into their stuff here.

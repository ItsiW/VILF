More of an overly snazzy vibe in this place than I was expecting. You can get the **arepas** in grilled or deep fried. Cheekily, I got the deep fried one.

The vegan option isn't too exciting, basic veggies and beans and plantains, but all in all it's pretty good. Great burrito alternative!

About $18 with tip and tax.

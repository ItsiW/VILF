Lmao a broccoli themed restaurant. I got the ~BIG SEXY~ bowl which has a little bit of everything. You get a decent sized plate for a bit over $13 after tax. Good you want a bunch of veg in you. Essentially a lot of various fried broccoli-centric foods. 

Theoretically it's fine, could even be good. In practice, they don't make the things to order, it's just a bunch of fried stuff sitting around in a bain marie. The whole point of pan frying a dumpling is so you can eat it fresh while it's still crispy, not so you can let it sit around. I'd rather get less variety but there's one or two things that are made to order.

Another thing, sticky rice is a specific kind of rice that has a specific texture. You can't just cook regular rice in a sticky-ish way and call it sticky rice. It feels very misleading. You know what this was? It was soggy coconut rice. And that can be fine, it has its place. I was just sold on an empty promise.

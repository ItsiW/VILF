This is like a modern Vietnamese kinda place. I got the **mean green**, you have to sub for a whole wheat baguette to make it vegan. The pickled veggies in it are really good, it also had mushroom and tofu. All in all a decent sandwich, but it's banh mi adjacent rather than a banh mi.

It's $13 + tax for a banh mi, and a small one at that, feel it's a little on the pricey side. At lunch you can spend $2 more and get a pack of chips and a drink, I got the **basil limeade fizz** which was refreshing, but you can also get Viet coffee. I don't like sweet drinks that much. Why didn't I get a coffee? I don't know.

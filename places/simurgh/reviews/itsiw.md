God damn this place is good. They got that **simit bread**, the Turkish slightly sweet sesame ring bread that's 20x better than a bagel. They have it with a **tahina-date syrup dip**. And the **sabich sandwich** is one of the greats, so tasty. Had a hibiscus tea, and there was good stuff on the **mezze sampler**. Just have to do a few substitutions to get all of this stuff to be vegan but it works.

Like $25-30 each after tax and tips but we got a lot of food and it was fkn good.

I just got the mock duck salad, some sticky rice and some peanut sauce. It was all a bit sweet, and not very spicy or vibrant. The mock duck salad is just not as good as the one at [Charm Thai](/places/charm-thai/). They've got a bunch of other vegan stuff but based on that I wouldn't go back.

Idk, email me if there's something else good on the menu.

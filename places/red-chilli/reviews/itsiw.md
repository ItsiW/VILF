Sometimes you need a late night **thali**... I didn't on this occasion but got one anyway. Decent curries, roti and pickles, and a LOT of food for $20 all up. Definitely enough for two.

Disappointingly their momos aren't vegan, but they have everything that can be marked as vegan, though it's not too much past the standards.

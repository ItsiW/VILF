I think this is just one of these times where I'm wrong. I think a lot of people fucken love plantain and I just haven't been that exposed to it and don't have the appreciation, and that's basically the menu here. Plantain in a bunch of different ways, mostly involving deep frying, but also desserts. However, I do appreciate people who are obsessive about some niche thing, so maybe this'll be the way to get into it, we'll see.

Again, Dekalb Market Hall, just awful, get out as soon as you get your food. Abolish indoor food courts.

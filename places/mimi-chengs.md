This place was a bit disappointing. They didn't have any vegan dumplings. I got a bowl of "dan dan noodles" which were soba noodles with a sesame sauce, I've made similar better stuff at home. The sesame pancake was pretty good. So if you want to pay like $7 for a decent scallion pancake then sure.

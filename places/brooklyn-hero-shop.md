I got the **Caprese** on a roll, it's not even a hero. It was a bunch of cooked veggies on a roll... it's fine. It wasn't super bland or super flavourful. They've also got a vegan mushroom sandwich.

I had to pay a bit over $14 and it really doesn't feel worth it. The name makes it feel like it should be a definitive authority on the subject matter of sandwiches, but that just adds to the disapointment. It's not bad but I won't be back.

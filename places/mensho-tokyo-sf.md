From the moment they equip you with a generously sized spoon, you know you are in for something extraordinary. Only a worthy ramen needs such cutlery—and worthy it was. The **Vegan G.K.O** boasts that it has garlic 5 ways. And indeed, it is marvelously suffused. Some of the ways are evident; pearlescent cloves and dried shavings bob in a rich broth, whereas others invite subtly and playfulness. Is it an oil? A salt? The depth of flavor penetrates well beneath the garlic, however. Roasted corn, mushrooms, and scallions create a riot of vegetal and sweet undertones. For something a little duskier, I’d recommend the **Vegan Tantamen** ramen. Here, a smoky influence converges with mushrooms and minced soy beans in a nutty harmony. The atmosphere is lively, the servers are warm, and as one leaves they cannot help but feel envious of those still awaiting their food.

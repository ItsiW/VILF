A doubles is chickpea curry in two small pieces of deep fried flatbread. Don't come expecting like a chole bhature where the bread is piping hot and has some crispy texture. This bread is kinda a bit past-fry and the whole thing is a oily satisfying mess. The chickpeas aren't too flavourful themselves but they've got a great mushy texture and the taste is carried by the various mango, tamarind and spicy sauces that go on it.

I think probably what you want to go here for though is the vegie fry bake. This is a more substantial fried bread with any number of their vegan fillings. I got cabbage one day which was really tasty (like fried with peppers and stuff) and okra another, also really good. In a sandwhich city with not too many vegan sandwhich options, this stuff is really good.

Highly recommend if you're in the area, I wouldn't be travelling just for it but it's solid. You can get away with a lot of food for like $6 as well so there's that.

This place has all the standard vegan options you can get at a Chinese place. All in all pretty decent but a bit too expensive. The **scallion pancakes**, **mapo tofu**, **cucumbers** and **veggie dumplings in broth** were pretty tasty. String beans and lotus root dish was a bit of a let down.

This place was meant to be good for soup dumplings but they took the veggie soup dumplings off the menu boooo.

I think a better choice would be one of the [Spicy Moon](/places/spicy-moon) outposts. There's one nearby in East Village.

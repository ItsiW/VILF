This is a taco spot that has a number of impossible options. I got the impossible lumia, which were kinda just fried sticks and a bit eh. But the **Quesa Impossible** was tasty, a taco cooked on the grill with a lot of chilli and some subbed vegan cheese (not sure which one, but basically a liquid), and a few other good veg. Hit the oily meaty spot.

They've got a few other things like loaded fries and tater tots, and some garlic noodles. I might be back for more snacks.

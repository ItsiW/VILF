This place has an enormous selection of baked chinese goods, dim sum, and take-away dishes for cheap. I came here at a suggestion of a coworker I asked if they had anything vegan and they said "everything has meat". It was true, even the seemingly vegetarian dishes in the window had pork bits or something. 

But then I went back and asked about the **sesame ball** and she conceded it was vegetarian and said it didn't have milk or egg. It's a fried sticky rice ball filled with sweet black bean paste. Extremely tasty and like one dollar and some change.

UPDATE: found the other vegan item, the fried tofu. It is so moreish and salty, with fried bits of jalapeno as well. About $5 for a (very large) small size, great value and I think about it a lot.

A Korean restaurant serving primarily banchan & fresh tofu, in a deli-like store with indoor and outdoor seating. The menu is fresh, local, and constantly rotating, but they always have fresh soft tofu (**DooBoo**) which you should get. If you don't really love asian pickles you will have a bad time here. This is the type of restaurant I'll open myself one day after I quit my 9-5 job and leave behind all my smug, self-important colleagues. 

It's ~$20 for a banchan set (4 banchans + rice + fresh tofu)

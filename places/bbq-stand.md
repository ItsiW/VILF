This is a street stand that makes **coal-fired bbq sticks**. Most things are of the dead animal variety, but they've got all the veggie things clearly marked, each under $2.

I got gluten chunks, king oyster mushrooms, and eggplant. Quick turn-around, and the gluten and mushroom were especially tasty.

Fantastic **dan dan noodles** with impossible meat. Like the spice is spot on, really good. I would go just for that. 

They've got more things on the vegan menu, I wasn't too impressed by the General Tso's Unchicken. But you know what, I could be wrong. I've never had General Tso's anything before, I'm not used to how sickly sweet American food is. This could be spot on for all I know. Give it a shot.

I'll be back to try the other things they have like the dumplings and xiao long bao, and hopefully upgrade this to a good.

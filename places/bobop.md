This place makes Chobop, tofu skins stuffed with rice and with toppings. Similar to Japanese inari. They are fun little snaccccs with a bunch of vegan options. Pictured is the **impossible** one. Tasty.

But they're pretty expensive. Over $5 including tips and tax, so get's expensive if you want enough to fill you up. I'm used to paying $2 for these bad boys in Australia, but that's enough of my whinging.

They also sell boba tea.

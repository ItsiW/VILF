This place has cheap and not too amazing handmade **veggie dumplings** and **sesame pancake sandwiches** but extremely cheap. Pretty similar situation to [North Dumplings](/places/north-dumpling), maybe a touch better? The pancakes were a bit fresher.

In any case I'd recommend spending a bit more and going to [Vanessa's](/places/vanessas-dumpling-house) around the corner. Better stuff, higher quality and more selection.

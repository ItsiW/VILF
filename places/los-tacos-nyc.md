Not to be confused with [Los Tacos No. 1](/places/los-tacos/).

These Tacos look good, but unfortunately nah. They had a soy chorizo potato one, which was a bit flavourless, and a bean one which was kinda just mushy. Also the price for 3 was over $16, just way too much. 

What they do well though is the salsas. Very tasty and spicy. I would buy those.

This dumpling place looked and sounded like it'd be great, but it was pretty disappointing. What looks like a beautiful dumpling vehicle didn't live up to it with pretty bland mixed veggie innards. I feel there's so many good things they could've done. We also got the soybean noodle salad, it was fine and a ginger and green onion noodle. Tea was pretty good. $28 a head after tips and tax, and I didn't feel like that was a lot of food either.

Nice vibes though?

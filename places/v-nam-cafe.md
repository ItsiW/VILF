A small Vietnamese restaurant. I got the **veggie pho**, it comes with a side of soy meat which was sweet but tasty. The broth was nice, definitely had flavour, and pretty big. Not super pho-y but a good soup nonetheless. And around $14 after tips and tax. I will probably go back sometime for a banh mi.

This is a massive Japanese BBQ chain with a horrendous upbeat poppy vibe if you're hung over. The music choices are sub-optimal. However, they do have a **Beyond Meat Bibimbap** which is pretty tight. It comes out in a big stone bowl and the sauce on the bottom gets caramelized and the rice gets crispy. All pretty tasty. I also got a seaweed soup and it was salty and nice and what I needed at the time but nothing special.

All in all $22 with tips and taxes, feels a bit pricey for a fairly simple rice dish but very tasty so not complaining.

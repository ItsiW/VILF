Everyone's sleeping on the **fried idly** here... they are phenomenal. This is a Karnatakan restaurant so other South Indian dishes are good too. We got a **thali** with a bunch of different curries, as well as a **paper dosa** (which wasn't paper thin but I like a bit of softness). Our Indian participant gave it a 7/10 dosa, let down by the chutneys which weren't great. We also got **sambar vada** which was swimming in sambar, fairly tasty. And a bisi bele bhath which I can ignorantly describe as like an Indian risotto, it was just ok and we were far too full at this point. 

It was fairly cheap, around $16-17 a head for all this food after tips and tax.

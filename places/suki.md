This is a japanese curry restaurant. The vegan option is with peppers.

It's very pretty but a bit underwhelming. Not too much flavour... the sweetness of the peppers really come through which is not something you normally expect from a Japanese curry. Definitely subtle.

It was like $23 all up with tips and tax. Not the deal of the year.

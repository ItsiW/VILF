This place is fantastic. Its focus is as a Lebanese Bakery, with one of my favorite foods, spinach triangle (**fatayer**) with onions and lemon juice and other tasty stuff. Far better than any of the other ones I've had in the city. It's got a bigger selection than its [other location in west village](/places/manousheh-bleeker), with plenty of other mains like hummus, foul, salads, the list goes on. I haven't tried them yet but I assume they're good. All the vegan options are clearly marked.

The place is very affordable, and to add to that, all the manousheh are half price on week days from 3-5pm.  I got the triangle and an arabic coffee for $7 all up. If you go early in the day the coffee is free.

It's got some nice space outside to sit, and they have Lebanese wine, beer, and arak. Also half price for the happy hour.

This is a Georgian cafe. They have a lot of standard traditional Georgian foods, with many vegan options. A lot of Georgian food is vegan already (apart from the overly instagrammed cheese bread) so no substitutions here.

I opted for the **lobiani** (bean pie) and **mushroom pie**. Wasn't a super traditional preparation but both were very delicious. Super flakey pastry, tasty fillings. Also they're huge for around $6 and $7 respectively. One of the best cheaper vegan snacks downtown. 

I'm definitely going to go back to try out their other options like lobio (bean stew), mushroom soup, dips, ajapsandali (veg stew), eggplant walnut rolls.

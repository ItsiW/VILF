This place is one of the few places that claim to be the original Mission burrito. Still not sure what the difference is between a Mission burrito and all the other ones I've had in my life, but you go girlfriend.

I think most other burritos I've had in my life are kinda meh. This one was pretty good. I got a **super fajita vegan burrito**, and the fajitas are pretty tight. Basically a bunch of veggies cooked in olive oil and garlic, goes real nice with the rest of what's going. I think it's like $13 all up, and you can get corn chips for like a dollar.

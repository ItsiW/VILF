This is a Thai place that does a lot of the standards and other stuff, but with excellent quality. I got the **pad makuer**, a eggplant tofu dish, and it was so good. The tofu is perfectly fried, there's a ton of flavor, and everything is coated in this delicious (I think shallot??) oil. 

They've also got quite a few dishes with Beyond Meat and fake prawns, and good prices for wine, beer, sake, and cocktails. I'll definitely be back. I think I paid a bit under $20 including tips and tax.

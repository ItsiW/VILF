This is the place to go for Himalayan comfort food. A Tibetan/Nepali cafe with an enormous vegetarian selection. You can get momos (spiced dumplings), noodles, stir fries, soups, salads,  all kinds of stuff.

So far, the salads have been the best thing here. They're more like fairly decent sized portions of curry that are quite cheap.

One time I got the dal and the **Himalayan Khatsa**, which is a spiced cauliflower salad with potatos, peas and tofu with a chili sauce/paste on the side. Also got a very spicy fresh ginger tea. I think it all costed me about $15, but I wanted to taste a bunch of things. I think for lunch I could get away with just one of the salads, it's pretty big. And tasty. The dal wasn't amazing but also $4 it's just something ok and nourishing.

Another time (pictured) I got the **black chana salad** which was a large portion or spiced chickpeas, and potato momos. The momos are ok, but I wouldn't get them again.

There's also cheap beer and wine! $5.50 for anything.

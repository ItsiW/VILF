A Tibetan/Nepali cafe with an enormous vegetarian selection. You can get momos (spiced dumplings), noodles, stir fries, soups, salads,  all kinds of stuff.

I went for dal and the **Himalayan Khatsa**, which was a spiced cauliflower salad with potatos, peas and tofu with a chili sauce/paste on the side. Also got a very spicy fresh ginger tea. I think it all costed me about $15, but I wanted to taste a bunch of things. I think for lunch I could get away with just one of the salads, it's pretty big. And tasty. The dal wasn't amazing but also $4 it's just something ok and nourishing.

I'll be back for a lazy lunch option to eat the rest of the menu. There's also cheap beer and wine! $5.50 for anything.

Cheap Chinese take-away similar to [Vanessa's](/places/vanessas-dumpling-house). A plate of chonky **veg dumplings**, bowl of **sesame noodles** and chilli oil was under $12 and it was a lot of food. Decent quality, very heavy. Gotta be in that wheaty mood. This was too much food for lunch. Sesame noodles were thicc and was good with the pickled carrots and better than average sauce. Nice chilli oil too.

This is a Chinese place famous for its **hand pulled noodles**. I made a mistake by coming here alone, I get that there's a lot more to this place than what I ordered. I got the veggie chow mein (with hand pulled noodles). I just needed veggies, I was hung over. It was kinda just salty, but the noodle texture was great. It costed $19 after tips and tax.

I think the pro move would be to come here with a bunch of people, get the sesame noodles instead, then like some eggplant, and string beans, and the onion pancakes looked great. Next time. I think I'll have to re-review.

More like Fox and Yes please. This has quickly become my favourite bakery/cafe in the city. The **vegan sandwich** they have is the best around, they make all the bread themselves, they've always got a line up of vegan savoury and sweet pastries (not as good as the sandwiches but fun and cheap), and the prices are surprisingly cheap. I think $10 for the sandwich.

They've also got a stock of beer and wine you can buy (apparently they're licensed so great for day drinking). Also they don't put too much water in their damn americanos.

Just an excellent place. Go get a sandwich and a coffee.

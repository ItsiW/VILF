All vegan Singaporean restaurant with fresh ingredients purchased Oakland's Chinatown. They have incredible sandwhiches (only on Fridays and Saturdays): the **Tauhu Goreng sandwich** on Fridays and the **Shaobing sandwich** on Saturdays. Sometimes when my annoying colleague starts to drone on about programming environment hygeine or magpie swooping season, I can tune him out by just thinking about how savory and flavorful these sandwiches are. 

If you foolishly come on a non-sandwich day, the **Three cup tofu** and Jackfruit rendang are solid backups. Sadly, the noodles here are a little underwhelming but still pretty good, especially since it's impossible to find vegan Laksa anywhere else. A.S.S. cookies & Pandan butter nian gao are good dessert options. 

Their daily specials are usually really good, although annoyingly, they are posted only on Instagram.

It's about $20 for a sandwich here.

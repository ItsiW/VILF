This is an all-vegan Latin American restaurant/bar/comedy venue. I kinda get the feeling is that it tries to do everything and things are fine but not amazing.

I got three **empanadas** for like $14. They had 3 flavours: beans and rice, fake cheese and mushrooms, and spiced potatoes. The potatoes was the best one. However none were that great, you get better flavour and textures from [KC Empanadas](/places/kc-gourmet-empanadas) on the other side of East Village. But it's still fine and it's good there's a vegan place like this.

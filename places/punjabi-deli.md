This pile of slop looked a lot better before they put the lid on. This is an all vegitarian Indian buffet situation. Most of it is vegan, but make sure to check on the day. You can get **3 curries and rice** for $8 cash and that's a big boy lunch/dinner. I got spinach, potatoes, and eggplant.

I'm not sure I like it as much as nearby [Pak Punjab Deli](/places/pak-punjab/) but I've been pretty tanked every time I've been there so willing to give it the benefit of the doubt. I'll need to go here drunk and the other one sober and compare notes. Check back in.

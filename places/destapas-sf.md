Nice tapas place with a cool back yard you can sit in. We got a bunch of stuff: tomato bread, gazpacho, **escalivada** (the grilled veggie stack), vegan paella, and some other stuff. All up it was pretty good. It was $53 for two people after tip and tax, so not so bad. Looks like a really nice bar inside if you sit there too.

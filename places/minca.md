Hole in the wall ramen shop. I got the **vegetable miso ramen** (without the egg) which is also peanut based. It's thicc af. It's tasty but unfortunately you need to sub out the wheat noodles because they've got egg, for bean noodles which aren't as good for the sauce. You can get it in varying levels of spicy. After tip and tax it was like $21.

The menus online aren't accurate as far as I could tell. But they've also got a veggie tomato ramen, and they said they could also do another one vegan, it was either a dipping one or a fried one, I forgot. But I'll be back to check. Also various sides.

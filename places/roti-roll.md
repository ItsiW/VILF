These guys do a good **roti roll** at a good price. Curry in a roti that's all wrapped up. The eggplant and channa masala ones are really good, so are the others though. One is a decent amount of food, I always mistakenly get two and it's too much.

I'm not sure if they're automatically vegan, but you can request them to be.

Don't get the veg momos, they're not great.

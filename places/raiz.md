New vegan Mexican spot in East Village. They've got a whole bunch of interesting looking options. I got the **Westside** burrito, which had a kinda seitany marinated situation. Really good.

On my next occasion I got the birria tacos and cauliflower bites. I like everything I've had at this place it's very tasty and the prices are reasonable.

Little dim sum restaurant. They've actually got a few vegan items, we got spinach steamed dumplings, and spinach dumpling steamed buns, along with some red bean buns.

Everything tasty enough, nothing worth going back for.

Not to be confused with [House of Dim Sum](/places/house-of-dim-sum.md) which is also not worth going to.

This is the least bad halal food truck I've been to, I got a **falafel pita**. The falafel was actually fresh and green, and they do the thicker pita that's grilled or something rather than a wrap, which is way better. Means your falafel doesn't get completely smushed up.

I was pretty drunk though so take with a word of caution. Probably needs more tahina and pickles but they always need more tahina and pickles.

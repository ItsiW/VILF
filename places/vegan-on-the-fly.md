We've done it everyone, we've found the most awful on-street seating area in New York. It's entirely the sensory overture that is midtown's fault, but the gaudy pink decor of the eating box just accentuates it. 

Everything here is vegan which is good. They make **gyros** mostly, which set you back about $15. They are big and hefty, and I say they hit that gyro spot, but that's mostly because of the pita which is pretty good. Probably the best ones in NYC, but I know better versions of this exist. This one is a bit overly saucy, and the seitan they make isn't super convincing. Overall though it does a decent job.

Got the wings as well, also far too saucy.

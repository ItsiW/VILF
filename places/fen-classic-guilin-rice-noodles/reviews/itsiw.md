This place does ~classic~ thick round rice noodle dishes. The only vegan thing there is a dry style which comes with a bunch of toppings and sauce. I imagine something is lost in this vegan version (and the soup has chicken in it so don't get that). I needed a lot of the chilli condiments served with it. But an enjoyable experience nonetheless.

I got it with a very tasty sour plum drink, and totalled to a bit under $20 including tips and tax.

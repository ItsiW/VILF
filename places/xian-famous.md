I was pretty excited for this place given the hype and pretty dissapointed, there's waaaay better Xi'an food out there. They standard biang biang noodles weren't even vegan when that's a pretty common vegan option in other places.

We got the **stir fried cold-skin noodles**, **spicy tofu**, **cucumber salad** and **seitan salad**. The stuff just didn't have that much flavour, kinda just oily and spicy. 

I miss the Biang Biang chain in Australia. They do these dishes but way better.

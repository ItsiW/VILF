So **cig kofte** are these comonly vegan turkish meatball-like things made of bulgar wheat, tomtato, walnut, peppers and spices. This place is also, very confuisingly, a crepe and waffle shop. I'm not sure what's happened here.

Anyway these are absolutely delicious and well made, although definitely not an always food. You gotta dig the west Asian walnut-pomegranate and herbs vibe. You get a big serving of 10 of the with a stacked plate of lettuce, herbs, pickles, lemon, and pomegranate molases for like $10, it's very good value.

Really solid Israeli takeaway place. The pitas run under $9, and while the falafels aren't the best, there's tons of other options like **sabich** (fried eggplant) and they were happy to swap out the egg for cauliflower.

I didn't notice it was primarily a hummus place so I'll try that and report back. Also they have ful and and a bunch of soups.

A great thing about it is that the turnaround is super quick, you can get your pita within two minutes and be out of the food court as soon as humanly possible.

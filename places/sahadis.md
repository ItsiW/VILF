This is mostly a grocery but they sell a lot of their own food too. Their **spinach triangle** for $4 is tasty but really needs to be served hot or fresh. They've got a good selection of olives (on the pricier end) and dips. Their baba ganoush is strong on tahina but didn't really get the roasted eggplant flavour. You can get better baba ganoush next door at [Damascus](/places/damascus).

I'd go back to try more things! Didn't try their bread or falafel yet.

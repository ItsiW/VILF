This is one of those times I think I might just be wrong. This is a vegan sandwich shop and grocery, heavily stocked with fake meats and cheeses. 

You can get all kinds of **sandwiches**, takes on classics. I tried *The Bowery* breakfast sandwich (pictured) and a cold-cut sandwich **The Monty**. Both were kinda fine, tasted like an assembly of vegan fake meat materials. I guess I'm just not a sandwich guy.

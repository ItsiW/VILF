The main vegan attraction at Hot Johnnie's is the vegan reuben. It is solidly meh. The house-made barbecue-flavor potato chips (not pictured) are fire, but not enough to offset the disappointing sando. Sando + chips together were $21 before tax and tip. The backyard is pleasant -- sunny with lots of fake plants and a ping pong table.

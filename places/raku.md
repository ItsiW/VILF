This place has udon soups and other bits and pieces. I got the the **sansai hot udon**, which is the udon in hot broth with some spinachy veg, mushrooms and maybe another veg I didn't recognize. 

The noodles themselves are really top notch. The veganized version of the broth may have let it down a little, it wasn't too exciting. And the veg didn't taste like much either (the vegan version has the mushrooms un-tempurad). But maybe that's a good thing. Apparently subtlety is something you're meant to enjoy as an adult. The noodles did shine through.

They've got a bunch of other options including ones with dipping sauce and cold ones. And vegan gyoza and other snacks.

Really good **pho**. They actually use the same vegan broth for their non-vegan options, so it's something they put effort into. It's definitely not just salty water here. Very forward on the shittake and anise flavours. It comes with a ton of mushrooms and fake chicken.

All in all, fantastic. The only downside is that it's served in plastic.

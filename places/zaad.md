It strikes you as a drunk college late night kebab shop, but the stuff has a pretty good standard. Everything is handmade and solid. The **falafel** isn't the crispiest but has good spices in it. The **baba ganoush** was good, had a strong tahina presence.

I'm not one for desserts but it's a pretty good **baklava** that's apparently vegan. We all know how hard it is to find good baklava. Good crisp to it.

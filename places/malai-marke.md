Continuing on from my South Asian Lunch Specials trip to [Sigiri](/places/sigiri) yesterday, I went for the **vegetarian lunch special here**. For $16 including tips and tax you definitely get enough for 2 people. The naan isn't vegan but they can sub in a big roti. You also get rice, dahl, fried cabbage, and a curry of your choice. I got the **Bindi Sasuralwali**, marketed as "Okra that you would Eat at your In-Laws House". So yeah kinda home-stiley not too refined okra in a onion tomato sauce situation. Pretty tasty but not something outstanding.

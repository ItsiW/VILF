Surprisingly, this Vietnamese/Pan-Asian all-vegan restaurant with a massive menu was actually pretty good. I just got the one dish, the **Vietnamese Fragrant Claypot Rice**, which had a lot of onions and was pretty tasty, though the rice wasn't as crispy as I'd potentially like.

I paid $15.50 including tax and tip, pretty good I think. Keen to go back and try some more things.

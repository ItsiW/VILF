The Sichuan/Japanese we all needed. They say they're a fusion restaurant but there's just two menus attached to each other. The Sichuan side specializes in their dry pot, which I might get next time but it's too big/expensive for one. I got their **mapo tofu** and rice. It was a little disappointing because there was no Sichuan pepper at all, but it was still tasty. There's quite a few veg options, all the standards, and I'd try more of them. It did come to $20 with tips and tax at the end though, it's the kinda place you'd be more happy paying 15 for a casual meal.

I'll warn you that I'm not an expert on Caribbean cuisine, but this was pretty good if a bit sweet. 

The lady serving us was really cool, whether she was Freda or not. She was like this software consultant at IBM for years traveling the world, then went into politics, and was now doing this grassroots campaigning while doing the restaurant. Cool lady. She also informed us that they were soon to get their liquor license and would be opening up for dine-in and drinks from December.

It seems like at these Caribbean restaurants the way to eat vegan is to get a plate with all the sides. Top notch were the **string beans** seriously packed with garlic and the **curry potatoes with chick peas** which were a bit like japanese curry flavour but better. Aapeli really liked the **Callaloo** which is this tangy spinach coconut okra mix, but we warned it is very coconut forward. We also got the candied yams (very sweet), fried plantains and steamed cabbage and carrots which were all as you can expect, pretty good. If everything was a bit less sweet we woulda really loved it but it was still solid.

You can either get it on roti or rice and beans, I prefered the rice and beans, the roti was a bit stodgy and you can get really good indian roti down the road at the indian places nearby.

We ended up here because it was one of the few restaurants in Chinatown open late at night. We got a bunch of appetizers like the scallion pancake, **shredded potato salad**, and **marinated tofu** which were really nice. The tofu was a perfect crispy/silky in a thin salty sauce, and potato salad is always good. What let this place down was actually the main, we got fresh pepper eggplant which was very bland.

I think this is the kind of place you want to go and sit at for a long time with the complimentary tea, and nibble away at a bunch of very nice appetizers.

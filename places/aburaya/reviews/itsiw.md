Aburaya is a Japanese fried chicken joint, and also has a bunch of beers and alcohol. They provide some vegan options like **fried vegan chicken** (probably Layonna) with many seasonings to pick from, fried cauliflower, and fried tofu, as well as a few appetizers. It's pretty tasty, nothing amazing. They serve the mains plates with a huge chunk of cabbage so definitely go if you're a cabbage fan.

I paid a bit under $18 including tip and tax. You get 4 bits of vegan chicken and a lot of salad and rice.

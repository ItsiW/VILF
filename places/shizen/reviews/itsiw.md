I'm sorry, I just don't think this is as hype as everyone says it is. This is known as like the best vegan Japanese/sushi around. There were some good things, but a lot of stuff just tasted like the sum of its veggie parts. I did like the **brussel sprouts** and the **kaarage**. Pretty expensive.

Definitely eat first before coming here, each one of those small plates of sushi roles is like $20.

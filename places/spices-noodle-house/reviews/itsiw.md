This is the noodle satellite office of [Spices 3](/places/spices-3) across the road. There are a couple of vegan options, I got the **cold sesame noodles** which were just swimming in oil. But you know, sometimes you need that.

They had a bunch of vegan looking dim sum and I got the veggie buns and boy were they bad. They went for the misc veggie corn and carrot approach instead of something reasonable like chives or mushrooms. Really bad.  I think I paid like $19 all up for everything? Don't quite remember.

I... suspect there's better things here. Hard to tell.

Sometimes great restaurants have the worst names. This is a great Punjabi restaurant off the highway. We got **black chickpeas**, **saag**, **samosas** and some other stuff that they could do vegan, they've got plenty of options. Just make sure to ask for it without the ghee.

It was well under $15 a head for everything. 

For some reason everything was fish themed in the restaurant, including in the bathrooms. Actually that was probably the best bit.

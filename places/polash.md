Pretty bland food. We were recommended an okra fried curry and chickpea and spinach. Neither were very good. The menu is enormous which is usually a bad sign. 

What was good were the condiments. Great cilantro chutney/hot sauce thing and pickled onions. I would buy those. 

Aparently the big draw card for this place is the lunchtime all you can eat buffet, but they said they'd only be starting it up again in at least 2 months due to the pandemic.

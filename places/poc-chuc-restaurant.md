Cosy Mayan restaurant. They've got this **veggie trio** which comes with a panucho, a salbute, and an empanada. Not quite sure on the exact specification of each but they were all very fried and very tasty, similar flavors to the normal veggie Mexican food around the mission, but a bit better I would say. I would go here to be full.

I paid $19.22 including tax and tips.

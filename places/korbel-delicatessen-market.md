We stopped here on a winery trip, it's a very pretty place to stop for lunch. They've got a deli there where you can make sandwiches and stuff, or you can get a **big bowl of veggie deli** stuff, I got beets and brussels and cauliflower and mushrooms and it was all pretty tasty! Don't remember how much I paid but I don't think it was crazy, under $20 tips and tax included.

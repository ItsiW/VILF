This Chinese restaurant has a bewildering and comforting vibe. The food is top notch. We got the **mapo tofu** (very good, but the tofu to sauce ratio was off), the **bacon and rice cakes** (without bacon), and the **taiwanese eggplant**. All of it was very tasty. Doesn't feel Americanized.

What I cannot recommend is the giant shared pandan drink we got which paired with just about nothing we ordered.

It ended up being pricey (like $40 a head) but you could definitely eat here for cheaper and they have lunch specials.

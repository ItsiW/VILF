This is a Sichuan chain that does really good classics with a ton of vegan options. You could smell the **dan dan noodles** (order it without meat) from across the table, and the **scallion pancakes** are crispy and flakey.

They can prepare any of the mains with fried tofu instead of meat, and while the kung-pao wasn't my favourite, they nail the fried tofu, and there's tons of other preparations. I've had the **cumin style** before delivered and the fried tofu didn't travel well but it was tasty as hell. So yeah, eat there and get the tofu. Or there's a bunch of other stuff, I'm sure it's good.

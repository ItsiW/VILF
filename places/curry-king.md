Another legit North Indian restaurant, across the road from similar restaurant [Doaba Deli](/places/doaba-deli/) across the road. $7 gets you 3 curries and a big plate of rice which is cooked with spices and veggies.

The stuff here is much more oily and heavy than the stuff across the road. Like I wouldn't expect to get much done for the rest of the day, and tbh I didn't, but also it was a Saturday so leave me alone.

They do some things well. Top notch **spinach**, **chickpea** and **eggplant** curries. The garlic roti was alright, for $3 it was not great value compared to the rest of the meal but nothing to complain about.

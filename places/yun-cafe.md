This is a Burmese cafe and store in a subway station. To get to it you have to enter the station at Diversity Plaza or across the road under the Wendy's.

They have a wide array of Burmese salads (which are delicious if you've never had them), and they are able to make a lot of it vegan. I got the **laphet** (fermented tea leaf salad). Not the best one I've ever had but still very good. Full of crunch and flavours.

Hope to be back to try more. They've also opened a location in East Village.

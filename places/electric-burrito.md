I was almost giving up on **vegan tacos** because most of the ones in the city are bland as hell. But these guys do it right. You got mushrooms, really tasty guac that comes through, some spicy stuff and cabbage. Good texture and flavours and quantity of lime provided. Paid around $9 for two but tacos are overpriced everywhere.

I will be back for a burrito.

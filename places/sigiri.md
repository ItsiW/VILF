You can get their lunch special of Sri Lankan **vegetarian curries** for pretty cheap. Ended up being $13 after tips and tax for way too much food. There were chickpeas, dal, beans, spinach, papadams and rice.

Everything had a kinda mild flavour, but there were definitely different spices to what I was used to. I noticed on the bill later that they specified mild (angery react) so maybe that's why. Felt very low oil and healthy. The dal was very coconuty if that's your vibe.

All in all a good lunch spot if you're quite hungry.

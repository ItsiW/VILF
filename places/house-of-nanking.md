This place seems somewhat of a SF Chinatown institution. I was excited to try the hand-pulled noodles but no one could confirm if the noodles were vegan. They've got quite a few vegan things just on the menu. We got the eggplant and sweet potato, which we thought was way to sweet, and the green beans which were ok. What was really good was the **mogu tofu** which was not on the veggie menu, but they just swapped it out from the chicken. Really tasty mustard sauce situation.

Forgot how much things costed, but dishes were $17ish before tips and tax.

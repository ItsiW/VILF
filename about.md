# About The Good Taste Guide

We assume you're here because you want to find good vegan food to eat in New York — actually good vegan food. We have the good taste, and The Good Taste Guide is here to help!

Simply put, we want to find vegan food that anyone would want to eat, whether that person is vegan or not. This is a critical resource that aims to make vegan food more accessible by providing an easy way to find good options wherever you are.

Our philosophy is that vegan food can be, and is, competitive with non-vegan food. Good food is good food. However, people tend to overrate vegan restaurants (usually coming from a good place), which can make it hard to find high quality stuff. A lot of food out there isn't amazing, and that includes vegan stuff. We want to hold them to a higher standard.

We mostly target food under $20 per person and try to only review places at the restaurant and not with delivery. And we don't review pizza, bagels or burgers. Or desserts. Grow up.

## Ratings Guide

- <span class="mono-info-about phenomenal">Phenomenal</span>: Amazing food, you should travel for this. We only give this out rarely.
- <span class="mono-info-about good">Good</span>: We recommend this. Go with some friends and order some things, you'll have a good time.
- <span class="mono-info-about sgfi">SGFI</span>: Something Going For It. While not everything was great, there's certain items or experiences that are worth checking it out for. We'd probably go back at some point.
- <span class="mono-info-about dnr">DNR</span>: Do Not Recommend. Sometimes really bad but not always. Mostly means we wouldn't go there again.

There is a similar <span class="mono-info-about dnr">Bad</span> <span class="mono-info-about sgfi">Fine</span> <span class="mono-info-about good">Good</span> <span class="mono-info-about phenomenal">Phenomenal</span> classification for value. Note that value is not the same thing as price, it's how we feel about the price relative to the experience, adjusted for how absolutely inafordable everything is in New York.
